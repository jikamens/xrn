Wed Dec  7 13:58:55 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-7.

Wed Dec  7 13:46:48 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

 *	* cursor.h, internals.c, mesg_strings.c: More
	internationalization/German patches, from kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay
	Marquardt), with some cleanup by me.

Mon Dec  5 22:28:48 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* buttons.c, compose.c, internals.c, mesg.c, mesg.h, newsrc.y,
	newsrcfile.c: Redo the changes to mesgPane in beta 6 a little bit,
	to prevent consecutive groups of messages from the different
	invocations of the same function to be appended to each other when
	they should be separate.

	* compose.c: Convert compAbortFunction into compAbortUtil and
	modify things that call it, so that the stupid "append" argument
	syntax is gone.

Mon Dec  5 19:33:05 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-6.

Mon Dec  5 19:24:41 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c (compSendFunction): Disable text redisplay when
	preparing a message for sending, so that the cursor doesn't flash
	all over the place when parsing headers in the message.

	* buttons.c, internals.c, internals.h: Modify killItem so that the
	newsgroup in which to kill is passed into it, and call it properly
	from places that use it.  This is necessary because the places
	that use it may cause the current newsgroup to switch after
	deciding what to kill but before calling it.

 *	* internals.c: When creating a new kill file entry, instead of
	replacing all special characters with periods, quote them with
	backslashes or square braces.  Furthermore, some characters that
	were being replaced with periods before ('-', ':', '\'', '\"')
	aren't special and therefore don't need to be quoted.

 *	* internals.c (killItem): For some reason, the code for adding an
	entry to the KILL file was truncated regular expressions in
	entries to only 24 characters.  I don't know why, and I can't
	figure out a good reason (if there is one, I suppose I'm going to
	find out about it now!), so I've changed it to only limit the
	input enough to make sure that XRN will be able to read back the
	written entry.  I've also fixed a potential array bounds read,
	although it's not a big deal because it could only be encountered
	for Subject or From lines that are more than 1023 characters long.

	* compose.c: When a post fails, don't try to append the "Saving in
	~/dead.letter."  message on the same line as the previous error
	message, because if it came from the server, it won't be formatted
	for that properly.  Also, only display the "Saving in
	~/dead.letter." message when actually doing the saving.

	* buttons.c, compose.c, cursor.c, internals.c, mesg.c, mesg.h,
	newsrc.y, newsrcfile.c, refile.c, resources.c, save.c, server.c,
	xrn.c: Change the way appending to the last message in the message
	pane works, so that it's much less likely that two messages that
	should have a separator between them end up without one.

Sun Dec  4 21:43:03 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>


	* mesg_strings.c: Add MULTI_MSG, for when there are multiple
	fields in a message.

 *	* compose.c (compSendFunction): Check if there are multiple
	Subject, From, Newsgroups, or Path lines in the message, and
	display an error and refuse to send the message if there are.

 *	(compSendFunction): When verifying fields in a composition before
	sending it, don't remove them from the message unless actually
	replacing them.  This is useful especially when running XRN on slow
	displays, e.g., over a SLIP line.

	* buttons.c, resources.h, resources.c, xrn-man.src:
	Add the stayInArticleMode option/resource.  When enabled, a number of
	operations in article mode which would normally exit article mode
	instead attempt to go to the next newsgroup.

	* buttons.c (artNextGroupFunction): Only rebuild NewsGroupsString
	if it doesn't already exist.  Otherwise, if all the articles in a
	newsgroup are killed while prefetching, we'll get confused about
	where in NewsGroupsString we are.

	* xrn-man.src: Improve the documentation for pageArticles
        slightly.

	* mesg_strings.c: Add UNREAD and NEWS_IN strings, to be used by
	internals.c and buttons.c.

	* butexpl.h: Change ARTNEXTGROUP_EXSTR and ARTFEEDUP_EXSTR to
	indicate that the next unread group, rather than the next group,
	is the one that's switched to (I hope I got the German right!).

	* internals.c: Use strings from mesg_strings.c for the "Unread"
	and "news in" strings.  Note, further, that these strings are now
	used in buttons.c in artNextGroupFunction.

	* xrn-man.src: Document that using rescanOnEnter will cause a
	delay when using "Next group" or "Fed up" in article mode after
	selecting "List old" in newsgroup mode.

 *	* buttons.c (fedUpART): Change the behavior of the "Fed up"
	button, so that it finds the next unread newsgroup even when "List
	old" has been selected in newsgroup mode.  Previously, if "List
	old" was selected in newsgroup mode, then hitting "Fed up" in
	article mode would exit article mode instead of going to vthe next
	unread newsgroup.

 *	(artNextGroupFunction): Do the right thing even when "List old" has
	been selected in newsgroup mode.  Previously, when the user
	clicked on "Next group" and "List old" was selected in newsgroup
	mode, this function would try to enter a whole bunch of newsgroups
	with no unread articles; now, it checks for newsgroups with unread
	articles and only tries to enters them.

 *	* save.c: When saving a message in an MH or RMAIL folder, if the
	save fails, say "failed" instead of "done" in the top info line.

	* server.c (digits): Add a function prototype.

	(getsubjectlist): Fix a bug which causes the article numbers in the
	subject index to be misaligned sometimes.  How to duplicate the bug:
	(1) Create a new test newsgroup. (2) Post five messages in it. (3)
	Read them.  (4) Quit from XRN.  (5) Post ten more messages in it.
	(6) Run XRN.  (7) Enter the newsgroup.  (8) Hit 'P'.  Note how the
	subject index line that just came up, for the last article you
	already read, has its number aligned wrong.

	* Imakefile: Check for the symbol "HPArchitecture" instead of
	"hpux".  Problem pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Delete the "-Wc,-Ns4000" argument in XRN_DEFINES when compiling
	under HP-UX.  I have no idea what it's supposed to do, and the
	compiler doesn't understand the option under HP-UX 9.01 anyway.
	Problem pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

Fri Dec  2 13:42:32 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

 *	* compose.c, dialogs.c, mesg_strings.c: More
	internationalization/German changes, from kay@zhv.basf-ag.de
	(Kay Marquardt).

Thu Dec  1 23:26:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src, compose.c, compose.h, server.c: Some
	fixes to the AUTHINFO GENERIC support, from "chris (c.r.) lewis"
	<clewis@bnr.ca>, with some cleanup by me.

 *	* server.c (start_server): Call close_server before doing anything
	else, to make sure we get rid of the file descriptors from the
	previous server connection (if any).  This isn't a problem if
	there wasn't a previous connection, because close_server only
	actually does something if it has a previous connection to close.
	This fix removes a file descriptor leak which would eventually
	make XRN no longer able to reconnect to the news server after a
	large number of reconnects.

	* error_hnds.c: Ignore SIGPIPE even if app_resources.dumpCore is
	true.  It's not an error condition for us to get a SIGPIPE, and
	besides, it doesn't cause a coredump, it causes the program to
	exit, so it doesn't belong with the other "dumpCore" signals.

 *	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src: Had the English and German button labels
	for "Subject search" reversed.

Wed Nov 30 15:12:28 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* xrn-man.src: Add some spaces in a list of buttons so that it can
	be wrapped.

Tue Nov 29 22:33:01 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-5.

Tue Nov 29 22:17:16 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* internals.c: Move the call to articleArrayResync in setUpGroup
	so that it's only done at the beginning of fetching the group,
	rather than at each stage.

 *	* internals.c, resources.c, resources.h, xrn-man.src: Add
	"rescanOnEnter" command line option and X resource, to allow the
	user to specify that XRN should check for new articles in a
	newsgroup when entering it, rather than only when rescanning all
	newsgroups.

Fri Nov 25 20:50:47 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* utils.h: Add putenv() declaration for SunOS.

	* clientlib.c: Code cleanup: Don't define XRNrcsid if GCC_WALL is
	defined.

 *	* XRn.src, XRnMotif.src, resources.c, resources.h, server.c,
	xrn-man.src: Patches to support new NNTP AUTHINFO GENERIC
	protocol.  Mostly from "chris (c.r.) lewis" <clewis@bnr.ca>, with
	some cleanup by me.

	* Imakefile: Instead of checking for "hp9000s300" or "hp9000s800",
	just check for "hpux".  Fix from "chris (c.r.) lewis"
	<clewis@bnr.ca>.

 *	* xrn-man.src: Fix the documentation for the ignoreNewsgroups
	option so that some backslashes that were supposed to appear in it
	actually appear in it (I forgot to double the backslashes for
	nroff), and document how to quote the list of ignored newsgroup
	expressions when specifying them either on the command line or in
	X resources.  Problem pointed out by olivier@lise.paris.sgi.com
	(Olivier DAVID).

Thu Nov 24 21:14:34 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

 *	* internals.c, resources.c, resources.h, xrn-man.src: Change the
	semantics of the verboseKill X resource.  It used to be a boolean
	which controlled whether the user was notified of messages that
	were killed and of the summary of all actions taken while
	processing a KILL file.  It has now been changed to a string,
	which can contain any of "j", "m" and "s", to indicate that the
	user wants to be told about articles that are marked read,
	articles that are marked unread, and/or articles that are saved.
	For example, "-verboseKill m" will only notify the user of
	articles that are marked unread, "-verboseKill jms" will notify
	the user of all KILL file actions, and "-verboseKill ''" won't
	notify the user at all of KILL file actions.

Wed Nov 23 21:10:04 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* config.h: HP-UX supports vfork, according to Michel Eyckmans
	(MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* internals.c: The definition for parseRegexpList should be K&R,
	not ANSI.  Pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

 *	* Imakefile, XRn.src (renamed from XRn.ad), XRnMotif.src (renamed
        from XRnMotif.ad), butexpl.h (new file), buttons.c, mesg.c,
        mesg_str.awk (new file) mesg_strings.c: Support for a German
        version of XRN.  Mostly from kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay Marquardt),
        with some enhancements by me.

	* Imakefile: Add a second "all:: mesg_strings.h" line, after the
	"all:: xrn" line, to make up for systems whose Make programs
	process dependences in the Makefile in reverse order.  This should
	fix the problem of "xmkmf" followed by "make" reporting an error
	about mesg_strings.h on some systems.

 *	* internals.c: When entering a newsgroup, use the first article
	number returned by the GROUP command, because it sometimes is more
	up-to-date than the first article number returned by the LIST
	command.  The biggest effect this will have is to prevent XRN from
	trying to retrieve articles that no longer exist (but that the
	LIST command doesn't know no longer exist) when the user clicks on
	"List Old".  Problem pointed out by Konstantin Laufer
	<laufer@math.luc.edu>.

 *	When entering a newsgroup, correctly tell the user when the last
	read article is being displayed because no unread articles were
	found.  This used to work properly; I'm not sure when I broke it,
	but now it's fixed.

	* server.c (getactive): Remove a comment about when to call
	articleArrayResync and when not to.  Remove an XXX that is no
	longer needed about the call to articleArrayResync.  Delete a
	couple unneeded braces.

	* refile.h, xrn-man.src, clientlib.h, xthelper.h, mesg_strings.c,
	config.h, buttons.c, COMMON-PROBLMS, xthelper.c, xmisc.h, xrn.c,
	xmisc.c, internals.c, utils.h, utils.c, server.h, server.c,
	save.h, resources.h, save.c, refile.c, newsrcfile.h, newsrcfile.c,
	newsrc.y, newsrc.l, news.h, modes.h, mesg.h, mesg.c, internals.h,
	xrn.h, resources.c, error_hnds.h, dialogs.h, dialogs.c, cursor.h,
	cursor.c, copyright.h, compose.h, compose.c, codes.h, clientlib.c,
	cancel.h, cancel.c, buttons.h, butdefs.h, avl.h, avl.c,
	error_hnds.c, XRnMotif.ad, XRnMotif.src, TODO, README, Imakefile,
	XRn.ad, XRn.src, COPYRIGHT, Xresources.sam: Use Id instead of
	Header in RCS strings.

Tue Nov 22 18:03:28 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* README: Add a note about doing "make mesg_strings.h" explicitly
	if for some reason Make doesn't build mesg_strings.h in response
	to "make".  Problem reported by Lucas James
	<jj@ldjpc.apana.org.au>.

	* Imakefile: Use the file name mesg_str.tmp instead of
	mesg_strings.h.tmp, because the latter is too long for
	short-filename systems, and conflicts with mesg_strings.h on such
	systems.  Problem pointed out by kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay
	Marquardt).

Mon Nov 21 19:27:13 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

 *	* buttons.c: Fix this bug: "If I press the <Prev> button when I'm
	reading the first article in a newsgroup, I have to press <Next>
	twice before I get the next article.  Pressing <Prev> more than
	once have exactly the same effect."  Problem reported by
	sturle.sunde@usit.uio.no (Sturle Sunde).

Fri Nov 18 19:39:53 1994  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* internals.c: Remove the newline from the end of strings read
	from KILL files before processing, so that if there are errors and
	error messages are displayed, they won't have the newline in them.

Fri Nov 18 17:21:52 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-4.

Fri Nov 18 17:18:24 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Declare gen_id() before using it.  Problem pointed
	out by nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).

	Use strftime(), instead of asctime(), to get the Date: field value
	when GENERATE_EXTRA_FIELDS is defined.  Otherwise, the generated
	Date: field violates RFC 822.  Fix from
	nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).

	* config.h: GENERATE_EXTRA_FIELDS requires strftime() now.

	* config.h: Reorganize the various #define's use to control host
	names, to go along with the changes to compose.c.

	* compose.c (getHeader): INN "fromhost", HIDDEN_FILE and
	RETURN_HOST are no longer used when determining "real_host".
	Instead, they are used when determining "host".  A new #define,
	REAL_HOST, has been added for determining "real_host".

	(getHeader): The "path" variable is now determined from "real_host",
	rather than "host", if no other source for it is available.

	(getHeader): A new "sender_host" variable has been added, to store
	what gets put in the Sender: field.  Support for a SENDER_HOST
	#define has been added.

	(gen_id): "real_host", rather than "host", is now used as the host
	name in the Message ID.

 *	Practically speaking, what the changes above to getHeader and
	gen_id mean is that when a user posts a message, the actual host
	he's posting from is more likely to appear in the message
	somewhere (i.e., in the Sender:, Path: and/or Message-ID: fields),
	unless the person who installs XRN defines REAL_HOST.  However,
	return addresses in From: lines should appear the same as they did
	previously.  The necessity of this fix was pointed out by
	nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).

	(getHeader): Use strncpy and strncat instead of strcpy and strcat in
	more places, to avoid memory overrun problems.  Also, make sure to
	null-terminate host, real_host, sender_host and path.

	* compose.c: Don't use INN's "domain" config value for real_host.

	* compose.c: Add a comment indicating exactly how real_host, host,
	path and domain are determined and used, because I'm about to
	change things around a bit and I wanted to have the status quo
	clearly spelled out before I started mucking with things.

	When using UUCPNAME, don't copy real_host into host right after
	reading real_host, because that happens later anyway.

	* xrn-man.src: Remove a reference to the FIXERS file, which has
	been removed.

	Use the RCS "Date" tag in the date header of the man page, so that
	the current RCS date shows up in the formatted man page.

	Set up some variables to be updated automatically when the program
	is built, and some files not to be included at all when they're
	not actually used in the local installation.  See also the changes
	to Imakefile to build xrn.man from xrn-man.src (to which this file
	has been renamed).

 *	Document unreadIconName and unreadIconPixmap.

 *	Update the documentation for watchUnread to indicate what the list
	separators are and to indicate that regular expressions, rather
	than newsgroup names, should be listed.

 *	Add documentation for the domainName resource.

	Fix some typos, and some other minor formatting nits.

	* xmisc.c, xmisc.h: Add makeDefaultButton(), to modify a Command
	or PushButton widget to indicate that it is the default in a set
	of buttons.

	* xawmotif.c: Code cleanup: Include <Xm/List.h>.

	* utils.h: Add a bunch of include files and function declarations
	on SunOS (defined(sun) && !defined(SOLARIS)).

 *	* mesg.c: Add a "clear" button to clear the text in the
	information window without dismissing it.

	* mesg.c, mesg.h: Get rid of the mesgEnableRedisplay() and
	mesgDisableRedisplay() functions, since they're no longer needed
	now that the code has been optimized not to reset the entire
	string each time a new message comes in.

	Move some X resources that were hard-coded in arg arrays into the
	app-defaults files instead.

	Some other minor code cleanup.

	* internals.c: Get rid of calls to mesgDisableRedisplay() and
	mesgEnableRedisplay().

	* dialogs.c: In Motif, use a RowColumn widget instead of a Form
	widget to put the buttons in.

	Moved the code for marking a button as the default into xmisc.c,
	so that it can be used from the Information window code too.

	Reenable an XtSetKeyboardFocus call for the Xaw interface; a
	comment claimed that it was causing coredumps, but I doubt that's
	true anymore, and in any case, it didn't say what X11 release it
	was causing coredumps under, and the only way for me to find that
	out is to reenable it.

	* copyright.h: Code cleanup: Don't define copyright if GCC_WALL is
	defined.

	* compose.c: Code cleanup: Include <libinn.h> when using INN.

	Code cleanup: Merged some blocks of Motif and non-Motif code so
	that fewer #ifdef's are needed.

	* buttons.c, compose.c, dialogs.c, xawmotif.c, xmisc.c, xrn.c:
	Code cleanup: Got rid of unused variables.

	* avl.c, buttons.c, cancel.c, compose.c, cursor.c, dialogs.c: Code
	cleanup, error_hnds.c, internals.c, mesg.c, utils.c, server.c,
	save.c, resources.c, refile.c, newsrcfile.c, newsrc.y,
	mesg_strings.c, xmisc.c, xrn.c, xthelper.c: Code cleanup: Don't
	define XRNrcsid if GCC_WALL is defined.

	* XRnMotif.ad: Added a few resources for button boxes in the
	Information window and dialogs.

	* XRn.ad: Added a resource from the Information window that
	doesn't need to be hard-coded in the binary (and removed it from
	the binary).

Thu Nov 17 22:25:37 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* Imakefile: Add the INNINC variable, to specify the directory
	where the INN header files are accessible, so that <libinn.h> can
	be included by the files that use it.

 *	* mesg.c: Instead of setting the Information window string
	explicitly each time a message is added to it, just append the new
	message to the text already in the window.  This improves
	performance considerably when XRN is being run over a slow network
	(e.g., a SLIP line).  A side-effect of this change is that the
	text in the Information window can now grow arbitrarily large; I'm
	going to fix that by adding a "Clear" button to the window to
	clear the text in it.

 *	* internals.c: Make the bottom info line message about what
	article is being viewed and what's next more terse, so that it'll
	get cut off less frequently.

	* xrn.c: Don't need to set icon name here on startup, since it'll
	be done by redrawAddTextWidget() or redrawNewsgroupTextWidget().

	* server.c: Use parseRegexpList() to parse the ignoreNewsgroups
        list.

	* resources.h: Get rid of the ignoreNewsgroupsList field in the
	app_res structure, because it's no longer needed.

	* resources.c: Move the code to parse ignoreNewsgroups out of here
	and into getactive(), where it belongs.

	* mesg_strings.c: Added UNKNOWN_LIST_REGEXP_ERROR and
	KNOWN_LIST_REGEXP_ERROR.

	* internals.c, internals.h: Added parseRegexpList() function,
	which is used to parse the list of regular expressions in
	ignoreNewsgroups and watchUnread.

	* compose.c: Code cleanup: Parentheses around truth values.

	* buttons.c: Improve the code in watchingGroup().

 *	The watchUnread option now takes a list of regular expressions
	rather than a list of newsgroup names, and the regular expressions
	can be separated by spaces, tabs, newlines, and/or commas.

	* buttons.c, config.h, internals.c, resources.c, resources.h: The
	watchUnread code is now compiled all the time, not just when WATCH
	is defined.

	* Imakefile: Add rules for generating xrn-man.sed and xrn.man from
	xrn-man.sym and xrn-man.src, and build xrn.man as part of the
	"all" target.

	* xrn-man.src: New file (renamed from xrn.man).

	* xrn-man.sym: New file.

	* server.c: Make SERVER_FILE optional.  Improve the message that's
	displayed if the server can't be determined (and move it into
	mesg_strings.c).

	* resources.h, resources.c: Add domainName resource.

	* mesg_strings.c: Add NO_DOMAIN and NO_SERVER messages.

	* compose.c: Don't put path element in struct header when INN is
	defined.  Clear Header in getHeader before putting stuff into it,
	instead of trying to initialize it with a constant structure.
	Return an error from getHeader if the domain name can't be
	determined, and check for that error in things that call it.  Pull
	the code that finds out the user's username out of getHeader and
	put it into a separate getUser function, so that it can be used in
	saveMessage.  Make HIDDEN_FILE, PATH_FILE and DOMAIN_FILE
	optional.  Make DOMAIN_NAME optional (except under VMS).

	* config.h: Document GRIPES better.  Document DOMAIN_NAME better
	and make it optional.  Make SERVER_FILE, HIDDEN_FILE, PATH_FILE,
	and DOMAIN_FILE optional.  Fix a minor formatting nit in the
	documentation for MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE.  Document DUMPCORE better.

Wed Nov 16 23:16:58 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* xrn.c (main): EditRes support can be compiled in if
	XtSpecificationRelease is anything higher than 4, not just if it's
	5 (i.e., it should work for X11R6 as well as X11R5).

	* newsrc.y: When reading the .newsrc file, display all error
	messages in a single chunk, i.e., use XRN_APPEND.

 *	* server.c (getsubjectlist): Line up the article numbers correctly
	in the article list when the numbers are not all the same length
	and some of the articles in the range are marked read.

 *	* internals.c (strip): Display and sort subjects properly when the
	number of digits in the article numbers in the newsgroup is not
	constant, e.g., when the unread article numbers go from 9990 to
	10010.

 *	* cursor.c (subjectSearch): Fixed an erroneous "Article not
	available" message when doing a subject search.

	* server.c: Delete a tab from the "Can't get the name of the news
	server" message, since it's displayed in a label instead of as
	text now that the window pops up before connecting to the news
	server, and since the label widget doesn't display tabs properly.

Tue Nov 15 18:36:07 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* xmisc.c: Only include <X11/Xaw/Text.h> and <X11/Xaw/TextSink.h>
	if not using Motif.

	* utils.h: Don't define _HPUX_SOURCE under HP-UX if it's already
	defined.  Fix from Richard Lloyd <R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk>.

	* config.h: Checks for "hpux" symbol should also check for
	"__hpux".  Idea for fix Richard Lloyd <R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk>.

 *	* XRnMotif.ad: Added missing labels for the composition pane
	buttons for Motif xrn.  Fix from Richard Lloyd
	<R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk>.

Mon Nov 14 18:47:21 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, patchlevel.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-3.

Mon Nov 14 17:36:16 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

 *	* README: Update documentation for ChangeLog slightly.
	Significant user-visible changes are now marked in ChangeLog with
	an asterisk in the second column.

	* compose.c: Don't try to use preprocessor directives in the
	argument to a preprocessor macro (in this case, XtNewString),
	because some brain-damaged C preprocessors (e.g., the one that's
	used by the SunOS 4.1.3 native C compiler) will choke on them.
	Fix from Odd Einar Aurbakken <oea@ifi.uio.no>.

Sun Nov 13 21:07:19 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* config.h: HP doesn't really need our version of vprintf,
	according to "Richard +Allen" <ra@os.is>.

 *	* mesg.c: When displaying the time in the Information window,
	display only time, rather than the day, date, time and year.  The
	day, date and year are almost totally useless and just take up
	space.

 *	* buttons.c, compose.c: Use XRN_SAME_LINE.

	* mesg_strings.c: Update strings (add spaces to the ends of some)
	so they can be used with XRN_SAME_LINE.

 *	* mesg.h, mesg.c: Add XRN_SAME_LINE to allow a mesgPane() message
	to be appended to the same line as the last message.

	* buttons.c, cancel.c, error_hnds.c, internals.c, newsrc.y,
	server.c: Code cleanup: Include XRN header files with needed
	declarations in them.

	* buttons.c, clientlib.c, compose.c, internals.c, xrn.c: Code
	cleanup: Get rid of unused variables.

	* buttons.c, compose.c, newsrcfile.c, save.c: Code cleanup:
	Parentheses around assignments used as truth values.

	* clientlib.c, compose.c, internals.c, tempnam.c: Code cleanup:
	Include more system header files as needed (<arpa/inet.h>,
	<sys/wait.h>, <unistd.h>, <signal.h>, <sys/types.h>, <fcntl.h>).

	* error_hnds.c, newsrcfile.c: Code cleanup: Use "%ld" instead of
	"%d" where arguments to *printf functions are long.

	* clientlib.c: Code cleanup:
		* Don't declare get_dnet_socket() when it isn't defined.
		* Declare get_server_init_msg() before it's used.
		* Give the return type of get_tcp_socket1() explicitly.

	* utils.h: Code cleanup:
		* Signal handler functions have only one argument under
		  Linux.
		* Include <regex.h> under Linux instead of declaring
		  re_comp() explicitly.
		* Add a declaration for re_exec().

	* save.h: Code cleanup: Declare createNewsDir().

	* config.h: Code cleanup: Although Linux has the tempnam()
	function, it doesn't declare it when compiling in strict ANSI
	mode, since it isn't an ANSI function.  Therefore, we'll use our
	own, which means we'll have our own declaration for it.

	* xmisc.c: Code cleanup: Include <X11/Xaw/Text.h> and
	<X11/Xaw/TextSink.h>.

	* internals.h: Code cleanup: Declare toggleXlation() and
	unreadNews().

	* avl.c: Code cleanup: Add some casts in calls to printf() when
	printing pointer values as unsigned integers.

	* error_hnds.c: Code cleanup: Add "return(0);" at the end of
	int-returning error-handler functions, even though they're never
	reached.

	* newsrcfile.c: Code cleanup: Declare yyparse() before using it.

	* internals.c: Code cleanup:
		* Fix a typo in the function prototype for
		  getUnSortedSubjects().
		* The comparison function passed to qsort should have
		  arguments of type CONST void * on _POSIX_SOURCE as well
		  as on __osf__.

	* README: Get rid of the list of supported platforms.  It's a pain
	to maintain and isn't all that meaningful now that so many
	platforms work.  Replace it with a short list of the platforms
	reported by users.

 *	* server.c (getlineslist): Properly parse "Lines:" fields that
	have extra whitespace at the beginning.  Problem reported by
	dstarks@rc.tudelft.nl (D. Starks-Browning).

	* buttons.h: Declare createButtons().

	* buttons.c: createButtons() shouldn't be static anymore, because
	it's called explicitly from xrn.c.

	determineMode() doesn't need to create buttons, because xrn.c does
	it now.

	determineMode() doesn't need to manage the ArtSpecButtons, because
	swapMode() does it.

 *	* xrn.c: Map the main window before connecting to the news server,
	rather than afterwards.  This way, messages about problems
	connecting to the server and about creating a new .newsrc file can
	be displayed in the information window instead of in the tty xrn
	was run from.  Also, if it is necessary to interact with the user
	while connecting (e.g., to do prompts for authinfo support), a
	dialog can be used.

	I've tested this change and it works under X11R6 with Xaw, but it
	might cause problems with previous X11 releases or with Motif.  If
	you encounter problems with the various panes in the window not
	being the right size when it first pops up, let me know.

	* mesg_strings.c: Add ARTS_NOT_AVAIL_MSG.

	* mesg.h, mesg.c: Get rid of mesgEnableAppend() and
	mesgDisableAppend(), which are no longer needed.

	* buttons.c, cursor.c, internals.c: getArticle() and
	moveToArticle() no longer display an error message when they can't
	get an article, so the caller has to do it.

 *	* buttons.c: Fix artListOldFunction() so that when multiple
	articles in a row aren't available, it displays one message for
	all of them instead of displaying a whole slew of messages.  This
	is important when the active file on the news server isn't
	renumbered properly.  Problem reported by
	Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.uk.

Fri Nov 11 17:39:45 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, patchlevel.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-2.

Fri Nov 11 16:33:54 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c (buildSubject): Fix an uninitialized variable.
	Problem pointed out by "Richard Allen" <ra@os.is>.

Wed Nov  9 23:45:47 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Make ORG_NAME optional.

	* config.h: Clean up the file a little bit, improve some of the
	comments, and make it clearer what needs to be configured.  Some
	of these changes were suggested by Wolfgang Roeckelein
	<wolfgang@wi.WHU-Koblenz.de>.

	* README: Got rid of the FIXERS file, since I note in the
	ChangeLog the origins of fixes.

	* newsrcfile.c: Use chmod() instead of fchmod() when NO_FCHMOD is
	defined.  Problem reported by Robert Broughton <bob@zadall.com>.

	* config.h: Add NO_FCHMOD for systems that don't have the fchmod()
	system call.

Wed Nov  9 21:36:51 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, patchlevel.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.01-beta-1.

	* README: Document that a template Makefile is now included in the
	distribution.

	* xrn.h: Include patchlevel.h instead of putting version constants
	here explicitly.

	* patchlevel.h: New file (required for comp.sources.x).

	* Imakefile: Move the stuff for building distributions into
	another file that isn't part of the actual distribution.

	* Makefile: New file (required for comp.sources.x).

	* config.h: SCO needs SYSV_REGEX.  Fix by
	Robert_Broughton@mindlink.bc.ca (Robert Broughton).

	* internals.c, save.c, server.c, utils.c, utils.h: Move inclusion
	of <sys/param.h> into utils.h, so that it doesn't have to be
	included separately by the serveral files which need it.

	In utils.h, define MAXPATHLEN if it isn't already defined, even if
	we're not on VMS.  Specifically, it isn't defined on SCO.  Problem
	reported by Robert Broughton <bob@zadall.com>.

Tue Nov  8 19:20:46 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* README: beta.tgz only exists if there's a beta release more
	current than the last production release.

	Add a paragraph about comp.sources.x and ftp.x.org.

Tue Nov  8 18:30:03 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.00.

Tue Nov  8 18:23:24 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* server.c (wrapText): One of the allocations of this_line was using
	app_resources.breakLength instead of maxLength, which is a problem
	(and can cause segfaults) if lineLength is greater than breakLength.

Fri Nov  4 20:39:27 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad: Add arrow bindings for artNext() and artPrev() in
	article mode.

Thu Nov  3 15:02:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 15.

Wed Nov  2 16:03:59 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* utils.h: Under HP-UX, need to define _HPUX_SOURCE before
	including <stdio.h>, because <stdio.h> includes <sys/stdsyms.h>,
	and defining _HPUX_SOURCE won't do the right thing if it's done
	*after* <sys/stdsyms.h> is included.  Problem pointed out by
	Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* strstr.c, strtok.c, vprintf.c: Don't include <stdio.h>., since
	"utils.h" does.

	* utils.h: Don't define index and rindex if they're already
	defined.  Problem pointed out by schuld@btv.ibm.com (Dave
	Schuler).

Mon Oct 31 16:22:01 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 14.

Mon Oct 31 16:20:27 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Make sure that From and (when specified by the user)
	Reply-To lines are included in all outgoing messages.  Bug
	reported by rcmodsb@mo6.rc.tudelft.nl (David Starks-Browning).
	Also, some other minor code cleanup which shouldn't affect
	functionality.

Thu Oct 27 16:12:31 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* buttons.c: Fixed a type in a function declaration that gets used
	only under X11R4.  Fix by dbrooks@ics.com.

Thu Oct 27 14:53:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 13.

Thu Oct 27 14:51:13 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* server.c (wrapText): Make a variable that is negated and used as
	an array reference signed instead of unsigned, because apparently,
	the expression "- x" takes on type unsigned if the variable x is
	unsigned, and the resulting value used as the array reference is
	huge and wrong.  Slightly different fix for this reported by Phil
	Garner <garner@signal.dra.hmg.gb>.

Wed Oct 26 20:50:31 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* README: Be more specific about what to include when reporting a
	working environment.

	* README: Updated and reformatted section about supported
	platforms.  Told people to provide details when sending me
	information about working platforms.

Wed Oct 26 18:14:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 12.

Tue Oct 25 13:06:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Only disallow ',' or expand '&' in Header.fullname
	when it was extracted from the GECOS field of the user's passwd
	file entry.  In other contexts, the ',' and '&' are not special.
	Pointed out by Michael Salmon <Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>.

	* Imakefile: Instead of having multiple definitions of
	EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS and DEFINES, define them once (in the section of
	the Imakefile that people probably don't have to edit) and include
	in them variables conditionally set elsewhere in the Imakefile.

	Instead of including $(MOTIFDEFINES) in all of the OS_specific
	settings of XRN_DEFINES, just include it in the one setting of
	DEFINES.

	* Imakefile, utils.h: Get rid of the special XRN_DEFINES for HP-UX
	in Imakefile.  Instead, if hpux is defined in utils.h, define
	_HPUX_SOURCE and include <sys/stdsyms.h> to get all the other
	needed symbols.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Mon Oct 24 20:21:20 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* error_hnds.c: Use VOID_SIGNAL, which is defined by the
	Imakefile, instead of a whole bunch of OS_specific symbols, to
	decide whether signal() returns a void-returning function or an
	int-returning function.

	* newsrc.l: Don't need to declare yylineno if FLEX_LEX_COMPAT
	(which will be supported in flex 2.5, according to the author) is
	defined.

Mon Oct 24 17:57:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 11.

Mon Oct 24 17:54:41 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c, save.c, server.c, utils.h: If we're declaring our own
	popen and pclose functions, call them xrn_popen and xrn_pclose
	instead of popen and pclose, so as not to conflict with
	declarations in system header files and not to replace behavior
	that library routines are expecting (e.g., if they're expecting to
	use the system popen and pclose).  Call popen and pclose as
	xrn_popen and xrn_pclose everywhere they're called, and if using
	the system popen and pclose, define xrn_popen and xrn_pclose to
	popen and pclose.  Fix the prototype of xrn_popen to agree with
	the prototype in utils.h.  Declare pclose in utils.h even if we're
	using the system one instead of ours, because unfortunately some
	systems don't bother to declare it.  The problems with
	popen/pclose were pointed out by Axel Nennker
	<nennker@cs.tu-berlin.de>.

	* internals.c: Because of a recent modification to server.c, a tab
	is no longer used to separate article numbers from Subject lines
	in the Subject array.  Instead, a space is used, so look for that.

	* server.c: Instead of always leaving five spaces for the article
	numbers in a newsgroup and putting a tab after the number on each
	line, figure out how many digits the last article number in the
	newsgroup has, and use that many digits as the width of the column
	for the article number, and put a space after it instead of a tab.
	This allows more of the Subject to be displayed when the article
	numbers have less than five digits, and prevents lots of
	whitespace because of the tab when the article numbers have more
	than five digits.  Problem pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

	* Imakefile: Move the OV_CAMBRIDGE configuration stuff into a
	single block and out of the way, so that people will be less
	likely to stumble over it when configuring for their own sites.

	* config.h: Linux doesn't need tempnam.  Fix from
	glenr@cu74.crl.aecl.ca (Glen Reesor).

	* newsrc.l, Imakefile: Newer versions of flex support a "-l"
	option which causes yylineno to be supported, but they don't
	support any way of determining at compile-time whether or not it
	was specified.  In other words, although the FLEX_SCANNER symbol
	can be used to determine whether or not we *might* need to define
	and maintain yylineno ourselves, it doesn't tell us anything
	definite.  I've file a bug report about this with the maintainer
	of the flex, but in the meantime, I've documented both in
	Imakefile and newsrc.l that the "-l" option should not be
	specified when building lex.yy.c from newsrc.l.  Problem pointed
	out by glenr@cu74.crl.aecl.ca (Glen Reesor).

Sun Oct 23 21:00:30 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 10.

Sun Oct 23 20:58:46 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg_strings.c: Add NO_NEWSGROUPS, DEFAULT_ADDED, EMPTY_ADDED
	and FILL_IN_RESEND messages, to be used by compose.c.

	* compose.c (Call_Editor): Instead of passing the template text
	into Call_Editor, pass a boolean indicating whether it should
	retrieve the template from the ComposeText widget and save it into
	the editor file.  This allows callers to tell Call_Editor to
	resave a modified template when in the middle of editing.  This is
	an enhancement, not a bug fix, and is necessitated by some other
	fixes.  Also update all invocations of Call_Editor for the new
	syntax.

	If the Subject field is missing, add an empty Subject field to the
	message and tell the user to fill it in and resend.  Also, if calling
	Call_Editor to re-edit the message, tell it to resave the message into
	the editor file.

	If the Subject field is empty, tell the user to fill it in and
        resend.

	If there is no Newsgroups field in the message, don't just put a
	default Newsgroups field into the message and send it.  A program
	should never post messages to newsgroups not explicitly requested
	by the user.  Instead, add a default (or empty) Newsgroups field
	to the message, and tell the user to edit it and then resend.

	In composePane, free the header template as soon as it's no longer
	needed -- a little earlier than it was being freed before, since
	it's no longer being passed into Call_Editor.

	* compose.c (compSendFunction): Don't assume that there's a space
	after the colon on the Subject line -- the user could have removed
	it.  This fixes a bug which could cause uninitialized memory to be
	referenced when checking the posting before sending it when INN
	was defined.

	* compose.c (newsgroupsStatusUnion): Don't miss the last newsgroup
	on the Newsgroups line if there are multiple groups there.  Here's
	an example of where this bug was a problem: compose a posting to
	two newsgroups, the first of which you don't get at your site and
	the second of which you do.  When you click on "Send", instead of
	posting the message, XRN will claim that you have no postable
	newsgroups on the Newsgroups line, because it misses the last
	newsgroup on the line.

	* config.h: SunOS doesn't need our version of strtok or strstr.

	* avl.h, clientlib.c, internals.c, save.c, utils.h: Use CONST
	instead of const in more cases.  Reported by Odd Einar Aurbakken
	<oea@ifi.uio.no>.

	* strstr.c: Declare the two arguments to strstr separately, to
	make sure that the CONST specifier is applied to both of them.
	Problem reported by Odd Einar Aurbakken <oea@ifi.uio.no>.

Fri Oct 21 20:01:44 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 9.

Fri Oct 21 14:05:22 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg.c, mesg.h, utils.h, vprintf.c: Be more paranoid about when
	to use stdarg and when to use varargs.  Problem first reported by
	jback@tristan.corsair.com (Joseph F.Backo).

Thu Oct 20 17:15:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 8.

Thu Oct 20 17:09:53 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c, config.h: Only include X-newsreader and X-mailer
	lines in postings and mail messages if
	IDENTIFY_VERSION_IN_MESSAGES is defined, and don't define it by
	default.  First requested by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr
	(Vincent ARCHER).

	* compose.c: The Distribution: header included in a cancel message
	should be identical to the Distribution: header in the article
	being cancelled, or shouldn't be there at all if there is no
	Distribution: header in the article being cancelled.  The default
	distribution in app_resources.distribution shouldn't have anything
	to do with what goes into a cancel message.  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

Thu Oct 20 15:22:45 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 7.

Thu Oct 20 15:10:13 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c: Allow DISTRIBUTION to not be defined, in which case
	an empty Distribution: header is included in postings if there's
	no other source for the distribution to be used.

	Don't include an empty Distribution: header in cancel messages.

	* config.h: Don't use distribution "world" by default.  Problem
	pointed out by Odd Einar Aurbakken <oea@ifi.uio.no>.

	Add more documentation about exactly what DISTRIBUTION does and
	how to use it.

	* compose.c: Put an X-newsreader field in all postings (or
	messages that are both followups and replies), and an X-mailer
	field in all mail messages.  Fix from Michael Salmon
	<Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>.

Wed Oct 19 18:52:38 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* utils.h: Include prototypes only if _NO_PROTO isn't defined
	*and* FUNCPROTO is defined.  Frankly, I'm not sure whether
	_NO_PROTO really should be checked at all.  I can't find anything
	in either the X Imake stuff or the X header files that defines it.
	I guess there's no harm in excluding prototypes if it happens to
	be defined, though.

Mon Oct 17 19:23:50 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 6.

Mon Oct 17 15:37:29 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg.h, mesg.c:
	Add mesgDisableAppend and mesgEnableAppend to allow mesgPane appending
	(the XRN_APPEND option to mesgPane) to be enabled or disabled outside
	of a call to mesgPane.  This is useful if a function A calls another
	function B that generates calls to mesgPane, and A wants the messages
	generated by B to appear in a single block.

	* buttons.c:
	In artListOldFunction, if the first article in the group is
	unavailable, step forward until an available article is found, rather
	than giving up.  Also, enable mesgPane appending after the first error
	is displayed, so that all of the errors about unavailable articles
	will appear in one message block.

	* Imakefile: Generate mesg_strings.h automatically from mesg_strings.c.

	* mesg_strings.c:
	Delete a message string no longer used by artListOldFunction.

	Add the string names from mesg_strings.h as comments in a specific
	format in this file, so that mesg_strings.h can be generated
	automatically from this file.

	* config.h:
	Comment out the DO_NOT_EAT_TYPE_AHEAD #define and add a comment
	indicating that it doesn't work right now.  Problem pointed out by
	Gordon Berkley <gordonb@mcil.comm.mot.com>.

	* xrn.man:
	Add documentation for buttons that weren't documented, and change a
	couple instances of "backwards" to "backward" in the button
	documentation.

	* XRn.ad:
	Get rid of the *ngQuit.info resource, set to "Quit XRN (app defaults
	file)".  Not sure why it was there in the first place.

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, buttons.c:
	Add buttons in newsgroup mode to scroll the newsgroup list.
	Patches from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* xawmotif.c: Need to cast argument to XtFree to char *.  Fix from
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Sun Oct 16 21:12:17 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* internals.c:
	Don't try to get articles in prefetchGetArticles if newsgroup->current
	is 0, which means that setUpGroup() couldn't find any unread articles
	in the group.  Before, a coredump could happen in this situation.

	* buttons.c, config.h:
	Force buttons in the top button box to have the same translations
	as the rest of the xrn window, so that hitting space when the
	mouse is on top of one of them won't activate it when using Motif.
	Fix from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang), with minor
	modifications by me.

Sun Oct 16 17:43:35 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 5.

Sun Oct 16 17:32:21 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* buttons.c, config.h:
	Force buttons in the top button box to have the same translations
	as the rest of the xrn window, so that hitting space when the
	mouse is on top of one of them won't activate it when using Motif.
	Fix from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang), with minor
	modifications by me.

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad:
	Make the up and down arrows do the same thing as 'p' and 'n' when
	viewing the list of newsgroups.  Suggested by Gordon Berkley
	<gordonb@mcil.comm.mot.com>.

	* README:
	Mention more about dxrn, including that it can be compiled to provide
	a DECwindows interface or spiffier Motif interface (MXRN) under UNIX.

	* still-to-do/cancel: Deleted this file because I cannot duplicate
	the bug described in it, and it was reported so long ago that it's
	likely that it was fixed in some other way by now.

	* error_hnds.c, error_hnds.h, resources.c, xrn.c:
	Patches from "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org> to support the X11R6
	session manager.

	* buttons.c, xthelper.c, xrn.c, error_hnds.c, dialogs.c:
	Updated to use application contexts.  Patches submitted by "Ralph
	R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* buttons.c:
	Updated the code in setTranslations a little bit.  Patches submitted
	by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* config.h:
	HP-UX has its own strcasecmp(), and therefore doesn't need ours.
	Pointed out by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* compose.c:
	Add _ARGUMENTS((void)) to the prototype for signatureFile().

	* butdefs.h: Wrap some long lines.

	* Imakefile:
	"Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org> says that Ultrix doesn't need to define
	NOSTDHDRS.

	I forgot to include $(MOTIFDEFINES) in XRN_DEFINES on Solaris.

	* README, xrn.man:
	Updated names of xmh-insrt-repl, COMMON-PROBLMS, Xresources.sam.

	* Renamed files whose names were more than fourteen characters
	long, so that they could be used on systems with a
	fourteen-character file name limit.  File name changes:
	  COMMON-PROBLEMS		->	COMMON-PROBLMS
	  Xresources.sample		->	Xresources.sam
	  contrib/XRn.bindings.emacs	->	contrib/XRn.bind.emacs
	  contrib/xmh-insert-reply	->	contrib/xmh-insrt-repl
	  contrib/VMS-CLIENTLIB.C	->	contrib/VMSCLIENTLIB.C
	Problem pointed out by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

Thu Oct 13 23:32:36 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* Imakefile, compose.c, internals.c, utils.h:
	Patches for OSF/1 2.0 support.  From Randy Coulman
	<coulman@skdad.usask.ca>.

Thu Oct 13 12:37:29 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 4.

Thu Oct 13 12:35:01 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* dialogs.c:
	Make an array static that doesn't really need to be static, because of
	bugs in older C compilers (most notably, compilers based on pcc).
	Problem pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent
	ARCHER).

	* clientlib.c:
	Make sure the server is in reader mode by sending a "MODE READER"
	command to it after connecting (and ignoring the error if there is
	one, since it probably just means that the server doesn't understand
	the MODE command; if it really means that the user doesn't have
	permission to go into READER mode, we'll notice the problem later
	anyway).  Problem pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr
	(Vincent ARCHER).

Wed Oct 12 19:46:39 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* Imakefile:
	Under BSD/386, need to link against -lcompat.  Reported by Matt Bush
	<xomox@boris.eden.com>.

	* server.c:
	Fixed a bug that was preventing ignoreNewsgroups from working under
	SYSV_REGEX.  Fix submitted by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* utils.c:
	Use CONST instead of const so that non-__STDC__ systems can compile.
	Pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* utils.h:
	Define CONST to const or nothing depending on whether or not __STDC__
	is defined.

	Don't declare strtok unless NEED_STRTOK is defined.

	* strstr.c, strtok.c:
	Include utils.h to get the CONST definition, and to make sure that
	the declarations in it don't conflict with the definitions here.

	* buttons.c, compose.c, utils.h:
	Delete the strstr() declaration from individual files and move it
	into utils.h.  Also, don't declare it in utils.h unless
	NEED_STRSTR is defined.

	* avl.c, internals.c:
	Missing _ARGUMENTS() around arguments that will only work if
	__STDC__.  Pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent
	ARCHER).

	* xawmotif.c, server.c, internals.c, clientlib.c, utils.h, avl.c:
	Use XtMalloc, XtRealloc, XtCalloc, XtFree, instead of malloc, realloc,
	calloc, free.

	* config.h:
	1000 is too high for MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE.  It should be closer to 320,
	which is 80*4 (i.e., allow a four-line signature).  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* README:
	Document that Imakefile and config.h need to be made writeable with
	chmod before being edited.  Problem pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* Imakefile: Use C comments instead of '#' comments.  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	Delete the text saying where to send suggestions, since it was missing
	an address anyway, and since that information is already given in
	README.

	* cursor.c, internals.c:
	Free memory returned by regcmp() when it is no longer needed.  Leak
	pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* cursor.c:
	In subjectSearch, assert that a search has been done before when the
	regular expression passed in is null.  This is just to make sure that
	none of the functions calling subjectSearch are misbehaving.

	* cursor.c, server.c:
	Delete some declarations that are unnecessary because they're in
	utils.h.

	* internals.c:
	When creating a regular expression to add to a KILL file, protect the
	')' and ']' characters in addition to '(' and '['.  Suggested by
	Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Add a comment indicating that I don't understand why special
	characters are protected by replacing them with '.' instead of by
	quoting them with backslash.

Wed Oct 12 13:13:12 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.00 beta 3.

Wed Oct 12 13:05:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* utils.c:
	Clean up the code for getting the time zone when
	REALLY_USE_LOCALTIME is defined.  The SOLARIS part of the fix was
	initially suggested by mitchell@aol14.wff.nasa.gov (Richard
	Mitchell 1026).

	* xrn.man:
	Update version number.  Problem pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* config.h:
	Change the print command for UNIX to "lp -sc" (for SYSV) or "lpr" (for
	non-SYSV).  It used to be "enscript -g", but far more sites have lpr
	and lp than have enscript.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Tue Oct 11 21:33:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* utils.h: Include <memory.h> under Solaris.  I'm not sure why this is
	necessary, since <stdlib.h> should get included and should declare
	malloc and realloc, but for some reason it didn't get declared,
	according to a "make" log sent to me by phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com
	(Phil Gross).

	* config.h:
	Sun doesn't really need strcasecmp.  Pointed out in "make" output from
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* Imakefile:
	Define SOLARIS and link against -lgen under Solaris.  Suggested by
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* utils.h, newsrcfile.c, clientlib.c, compose.c, internals.c, refile.c, resources.c, save.c, utils.c, server.c:
	Move "#define index strchr" out of C files into utils.h.  Also, add
	"#define rindex strrchr", and make sure this happens on VMS, SOLARIS
	and SYSV.  phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross) pointed out the
	need for this fix.

	* clientlib.c:
	Solaris no longer needs a different getservbyname declaration.  Fix
	from phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* MotifXawHack.h:
	Fix another function prototype vs. promoted argument problem that
	didn't turn up before because it's in the Motif code.  Problem
	reported by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* mesg.c:
	Need to include <Xm/Label.h> when doing Motif, because we're using
	XmCreateLabel.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* internals.c:
	Change the message in the info line when KILL file processing is done.
	Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Say in the info line message what newsgroup's KILL file is being
	processed.

	* Imakefile:
	Add XRN_DEFINES for HPArchitecture.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Indent the #ifdef's in the XRN_DEFINES block, to make the nesting
	clearer.

	* Imakefile:
	Don't assume that everyone is using GNU make -- don't use GNU make
	"ifdef ... else ... endif" construct unless OV_CAMBRIDGE is defined.
	Pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* Imakefile, utils.h:
	Use HasVoidSignalReturn in the Imakefile to determine whether signal
	handlers should return void.  Simply the declaration of SIG_PF0 in
	utils.h to use the VOID_SIGNAL symbol defined if necessary by the
	Imakefile, and also to use _ARGUMENTS() for the arguments of the
	SIG_PF0 typedef.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Tue Oct 11 16:22:49 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h: Update version number for beta 2.

Tue Oct 11 16:12:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c:
	Can't take the address of an array in a call to buildSubject.
	Instead, assign its address to a pointer and take the address of
	that.  Reported by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* resources.c:
	Delete the separate command-line option list for VMS, and instead
	convert the options in it to lower case under VMS before calling
	XtInitialize.

	* compose.c:
	Always include article text when calling an external editor command.
	Fix from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* config.h:
	Add a comment (from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland)) documenting
	XRN_PREFETCH_UNREAD_ONLY.

	* README, config.h:
	Add CONFIG_H_IS_OK symbol to config.h, which determines whether or
	not to print the error about editing config.h, so that people can
	configure the program by editing only the Imakefile.  Document
	this change in README.  Change suggested by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

	* README:
	Document what to do about OV_CAMBRIDGE and "#error" in the config.h
	file.  The need for this was first pointed out by Jay Vassos-Libove
	<libove@libove.mindspring.com>.

	* buttons.c:
	TRANSLATIONS_NOT_FREED patch in setTranslations.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* MotifXawHack.h, dialogs.c, mesg.c, xawmotif.c, xrn.c:
	Patches for Motif support from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* utils.h:
	Correct malloc and realloc declarations for SGI.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* xrn.c:
	Missing arguments for the NO_APP_DEFAULTS_MSG string in a call to
	mesgPane.  First pointed out by mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* utils.h, internals.c:
	Delete regexp routine declarations from internals.c and add them to
	utils.h (well, actually, most of them were already duplicated in
	utils.h, but the declaration for regex() was missing).

	* compose.c:
	Arguments to XtVaCreateManagedWidget should be cast to XtArgVal, not
	XtPointer.  First pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per
	Hedeland).

	* buttons.c, cursor.h, error_hnds.h, internals.c, server.h:
	Change some prototype arguments to "int" so that there aren't
	conflicts with K&R function definitions that cause arguments to be
	promoted to int.

	* strstr.c:
	Insert a couple of casts to get rid of warnings from the compiler.

	* compose.c: strncmp should have been strcasecmp.  First pointed
	out by mush@sunota.cat.com (Paul Mauschbaugh).
