Sat Sep 30 19:34:16 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-10.

Sat Sep 30 19:03:46 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* xrn-man.src, resources.c: Fix a problem reported by
 	wilker@math.purdue.edu (Clarence W. Wilkerson): There's no way to
 	disable an external editorCommand from the command line if it's
 	set in the X resources, or from personal X resources if it's set
 	in the app-defaults file.  Now, it can be disabled by specifying
 	an empty editorCommand.

	* Imakefile: Fix a problem reported by Tim <tda10@cus.cam.ac.uk>:
 	The regular expression component '\("\|\)' isn't portable.  Use
 	'"*' instead.

Fri Sep 29 08:02:08 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, artMode.c, cancel.c, cancel.h: Fix bug reported by
 	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu): the cancel
 	button for the "List old" operation should say "Cancel" instead
 	of "Cancel search", since it's not actually doing a search.

Wed Sep 27 19:40:12 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-9.

Wed Sep 27 19:38:10 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* internals.c (enterNewsgroup): Don't call groupSnapshotSave() or
 	change CurrentGroup when returning XRN_NOUNREAD when the
 	ENTER_UNREAD flag is set.  Before, groupSnapshotSave() was being
 	called and CurrentGroup was being set even when enterNewsgroup()
 	was returning an error to the caller.  This may have been causing
 	various subtle bugs that I don't know about, but the one I *do*
 	know about is that it was causing a temporary-file leak which is
 	now fixed.

	* internals.c, save.c, server.c, utils.h: Add debugging code for
 	temporary-file leaks.

	* config.h, utils.h: Use the tempnam() in the C library on Linux,
 	even if this does mean that there's no declaration for it in the
 	Linux header files.

	* config.h, utils.h: "#define utTempnam tempnam" belongs in
 	utils.h, not in config.h.

	* allMode.c (doAll): Detect when we have to redraw the entire
 	newsgroup list because we're changing a group to or from "ignored"
 	status, and the newsgroup list is displayed in Newsrc order, which
 	means that all of the ignored groups are displayed at the end.

	* cursor.c (currentMode): Use strncmp() instead of strmp() when
 	checking whether a group is currently subscribed, unsubscribed or
 	ignored, so that we won't get confused if it's not the last group
 	in the list.  I introduced this bug in revision 1.20 (i.e., in
 	release 7.01-beta-19); it's amazing that it hasn't been discovered
 	before now :-).

 *	* allMode.c (allMoveFunction): Fix a bug which was causing XRN to
	spin-dry (i.e., to go into an infinite loop) when the user
	attempted to move newsgroups in his .newsrc.

Tue Sep 26 19:51:29 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-8.

Tue Sep 26 19:50:29 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* activecache.c: Need to include <errno.h>.  This problem was
 	pointed out by numerous people, the first of whom was "Ivar
 	Ruyter" <ivarr@troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de>.

 *	* internals.c (rescanWorkProc): Call doPrefetch() after fetching
 	new statistics about a group, if it's not the currently prefetched
 	group.  This way, if there were previously no unread articles (so
 	that no group was prefetched) and then we discover a group with
 	unread articles, it is prefetched immediately.

Sun Sep 24 13:19:07 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-7.

Sun Sep 24 13:07:15 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* internals.c (articleIsAvailable): If we've already got a file
 	for an article, then assume that the article is available without
 	checking if its Subject can be retrieved from the server.  This
	should prevent a small amount of unnecessary traffic with the
	server.

 *	* artstruct.c (freeartstruct): Unlink temporary files when freeing
 	article structures.  I believe this fixes a temporary-file leak
	(i.e., I believe it prevents XRN from leaving some files in /tmp
	when it exits).

 *	* addMode.c, internals.c, internals.h: Fix bug reported by
 	Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr (Jean-Marc Lasgouttes): "When new
 	newsgroups appear, xrn presents them to me at each rescan, until I
 	leave the program to update .newsrc (or the cache perhaps). This
 	with fullNewsrc set to false, if it makes a difference."

	* internals.c (setUpGroupIncremental): Don't call
 	setCurrentArticle() until we're actually done processing the KILL
 	file.  This prevents a small amount of unnecessary traffic with
	the server.

	* activecache.c, cache.h (new file), varfile.c: Use #define's to
 	represent the prefixes for the lines in the cache file, instead of
 	hard-coding them.

	* server.c (check_server_response): Don't call getactive().

	* allMode.c, artMode.c, mesg_strings.c, ngMode.c: Convert
 	UNKNOWN_ENTER_NG_RESPONSE_MSG to more generic
 	UNKNOWN_FUNC_RESPONSE_MSG.

	* mesg_strings.c: Delete UNKNOWN_FIND_UNRD_RESPONSE_MSG, which is
 	no longer used.

 *	* Imakefile, XRn.src, activecache.c (new file), activecache.h (new
 	file), butexpl.h, internals.c, internals.h, mesg_strings.c,
 	newsrc.y, newsrcfile.c, newsrcfile.h, ngMode.c, ngMode.h,
 	resources.c, resources.h, server.c, server.h, xrn-man.src: Added
 	the new "cacheActive" resource and the "ngGetList" command in
 	newsgroup mode.  When "cacheActive" is set to True (by default, it
 	is False), XRN will cache the server's newsgroup list so that it
 	doesn't have to retrieve the whole list every time it starts up
 	and every time it does a "Rescan", and the "Rescan" command does
 	the rescan group-by-group instead of retrieving a full list, and
 	it does the rescan in the background so you can do other things
 	(such as reading the articles in a group that has already been
 	rescanned) while it's going on.

	This new functionality will probably be used most frequently by
	people reading news over a SLIP or PPP link who don't want to
	download a complete newsgroup list every time they check for new
	articles.

	Note that the first time you run XRN with "cacheActive" enabled,
	it will have to retrieve a full newsgroup list in order to prime
	the cache.

Wed Sep 20 10:09:14 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* utils.h: According to Chris Torek <torek@purr.bsdi.com>, signal
 	handlers on BSDI have only one argument.

Fri Sep 15 07:25:38 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* config.h: Add more information to the comment above GRIPES
 	indicating that people installing XRN for other people to use
 	should modify the GRIPES address so that questions go to them
 	first.

Sun Sep 10 13:52:58 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-6.

Sun Sep 10 13:14:33 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* compose.c: Fix bug reported by dyson@sunfish.physics.uiowa.edu
 	(Richard L. Dyson): Coredump (overrunning allocated memory) when
 	IDENTIFY_VERSION_IN_MESSAGES is defined.

	* config.h, utils.c: Support REALLY_USE_LOCALTIME on Linux.  Linux
 	has mktime(), so it doesn't need the makeTime() function in
 	utils.c.

	* Imakefile, XRn.src: Substitute the app-defaults class when
 	building XRn.ad from XRn.src, instead of hard-coding it in
 	XRn.src.  Problem pointed out by Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr
 	(Jean-Marc Lasgouttes).

	* varfile.c: Need to include <errno.h> for ENOENT.  This bug was
 	pointed out by several people; the first person to mention it to
 	me was pawliger@mv.us.adobe.com (Marc Pawliger).

	* varfile.h: Protect against multiple inclusions.

Fri Sep  8 07:49:50 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* varfile.c (var_read_write_file): Fix coredump bug when the input
 	file doesn't exist.  Fix from pawliger@mv.us.adobe.com (Marc
 	Pawliger).

Thu Sep  7 22:49:55 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-5.

Thu Sep  7 22:45:12 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* internals.c (removeFromNewsrc): When moving a newsgroup in the
 	newsrc, need to update its newsrc line number in its structure as
 	well as its location in the newsrc array.

Thu Sep  7 21:49:12 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-4.

Thu Sep  7 21:28:10 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* xrn-man.src: Alphabetize command-line options, delete some
 	unnecessary stuff, add some missing stuff.

	* resources.c: Reindent the XtResource table, normalize all "XtC"
 	constants so that the letter after the 'C' is capitalized,
 	alphabetize the various lists of resources and command-line
 	options so that they're easier to keep in sync with themselves and
 	with the man page.

	* xrn-man.src, xrn-man.sym: Add a couple compile-time variables to
	the man page.

	* Imakefile, resources.c: Fix the rule for generating the man page
 	so that it will be correct even if the name of the program is
 	changed, and define XRN_APP_CLASS when compiling and use it in
 	resources.c to determine the application class.  Suggested by
 	Jean-Marc Lasgouttes <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>.

	* mesg_strings.c, newsrcfile.c, save.c, utils.c, utils.h:
 	Generalize the code for looking for file names of the form
 	"name-server", so that it can be used to find the cache file as
 	well as the newsrc file.  Also, generalize the error messages
 	about expanding file names and directories.

 *	* Imakefile, XRn.src, addMode.c, addMode.h, allMode.c, allMode.h,
 	butexpl.h, config.h, cursor.c, internals.c, internals.h,
 	mesg_strings.c, news.h, newsrc.y, newsrcfile.c, resources.c,
 	resources.h, server.c, server.h, varfile.c (new file), varfile.h
 	(new file), xrn-man.src: Add the cacheFile and fullNewsrc X
 	resources, and the functionality that goes with them.  When
 	fullNewsrc is false, then XRN uses the NNTP NEWGROUPS command to
 	determine when new newsgroups are created, and stores the date of
 	the last NEWGROUPS command in the cache file.  It no longer
 	requires that all newsgroups known to the server exist in the
 	newsrc file.  The default is still for fullNewsrc to be true, so
 	that the default behavior does not change.
	
Tue Sep  5 19:10:21 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
 	7.04-beta-3.

Tue Sep  5 18:57:22 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* compose.c, compose.h, mesg_strings.c, ngMode.c: Don't let the
 	user quit or exit from the program if a composition is pending.

	* artMode.c: If killing an author instead of a subject, then the
 	message displayed after killing should say "Author has been
 	killed" instead of "Subject has been killed".

	* server.c (getlineslist): Don't retrieve anything if
 	displayLineCount is false.

	* xthelper.c, xthelper.h: Add support in xthWaitForMapped for
 	waiting for an expose event too.

	* xthelper.c: Add some debugging support to
 	xthHandleAllPendingEvents.

	* xrn.c: xthWaitForMapped() now has an extra argument to specify
 	whether an expose event should also be waited for.  We're not
 	using that functionality here, but we still need to specify False
 	as the new argument.

	* internals.c, internals.h: Make it possible for fillUpArray() to
 	be aborted part-way through.

	* cursor.c: fillUpArray() now has another argument and a return
 	value, because it can be told to allow an abort in the middle of
 	its work.  We're not using that functionality here, but we still
 	need to account for the new argument.

 *	* cancel.c: When creating a cancel button, wait until it's mapped
 	and gets an expose event, and then process all pending events so
 	that its label will be drawn properly, before returning.  This
 	way, cancel buttons will be popped up and drawn when they're
 	supposed to be instead of being delayed.

 *	* artMode.c: Add a cancel button to "List Old" in article mode.
  	This was suggested by George Ross <gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk>.
  	Unfortunately, it's not possible to do this really well without
 	significantly slowing down the performance of the "List Old"
 	command, at least not until the program is multi-threaded or talks
 	to the NNTP server in a sub-process or something like that.  With
 	this change, the "List Old" can be aborted either one-third of the
 	way through the work it does or two-thirds of the way through.
  	It's not very good granularity, but it's better than nothing.

	* resources.c: Alphabetize the options in the usage message, and
 	delete one redundant one.

Tue Aug 22 09:34:20 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Another fix for the GENERATE_EXTRA_FIELDS Date code
 	from nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).

 *	* internals.c: Fix bug reported by Michael Schmitz
 	<schmitz@ph-cip.Uni-Koeln.DE>: "Users that do not have a .newsrc
 	file will not see the NEWUSER_GROUPS after startup. I experienced
 	that this is independent of the platform xrn runs on. Added
 	newsgroups will appear in the ng mode (if they are not empty) but
 	the NEWUSER_GROUPS will only appear after doing a 'rescan'.  On
 	the other hand, when you leave without doing a rescan, all
 	articles in the NEWUSER_GROUPS are marked as read!"

	* config.h: "Vyacheslav Shubinsky, Computer Specialist, Towson, MD
 	"<slava@usgs.gov> says that we need to use putenv on DGUX.

	* config.h: There were two blocks of code defining USE_PUTENV.  I
 	removed one of them.

	* server.c (getlist): Verify that each line returned by the XHDR
 	command is in the proper format; if not, display an error message
 	and ignore it.  This is an attempt to fix or get more information
 	about a problem reported by Joe Konstan <konstan@cs.umn.edu>.

 *	* compose.c, mesg_strings.c: Improvement suggested by Harald
 	Leinders <hl@arthur.ph2.Uni-Koeln.DE>: when the signature file is
 	too big to be included, display a warning instead of ignoring it
 	silently, so that the user knows why it was ignored (instead of
 	thinking that XRN is broken).

Fri Jul  7 16:47:52 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* resources.c (Initialize): Fix a small memory leak.

Thu Jun 29 19:03:50 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c (includeHandler): Close a file included in an article
 	when done including it.  Bug pointed out by
 	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu).

	* mesg.c (_info): Keep track of which widget we actually last set
 	a message in, as well as what the message was, so that if the info
 	widget changes, we know to update it.

Fri Jun 16 12:36:31 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* server.c: Don't free the filename until after using it to
 	generate an error in getarticle().

Mon Jun 12 19:23:51 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* COMMON-PROBLMS, README, README.Linux (new file): Document that
 	there are problems with the regular-expression routines in Linux
 	libc.

Fri Jun  9 22:08:21 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* utils.c: Add parentheses around an expression used as a truth
 	value.  Pointed out by Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr (Jean-Marc
 	Lasgouttes).

	* internals.c: Move '{' and '}' into the list of characters which
 	should be quoted in regexps by enclosing them in square braces,
 	rather than by backslashing them.

Thu Jun  8 02:05:07 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* artMode.c, buttons.c, config.h, internals.c, internals.h,
 	server.c: Support POSIX regular expression routines, and use them
 	on Linux.

Wed Jun  7 01:29:00 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* server.c: Patch from "David A. Curry" <davy@ecn.purdue.edu> to
 	fix a null-pointer dereference when parsing "From:" lines when
 	authorFullName is false.

Tue Jun  6 23:49:50 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* ngMode.c: Fix bug reported by
 	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu): Newsgroup
 	mode says "No more unread articles in the subscribed to
 	newsgroups" even when there are, in fact, unread articles.

 *	* compose.c: Check for (and reject) an empty Subject: lines all
 	the time, not just when INN is defined.

Thu Jun  1 17:04:50 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* mesg_strings.c: A german translation of the NO_APP_DEFAULTS
 	message, from kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay Marquardt).

Wed May 31 16:05:07 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* mesg_strings.c: The german NO_APP_DEFAULTS message should not
 	have %s in it.  This fix prevents a coredump when the app-defaults
	file isn't installed.

Mon May 15 23:22:48 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src: Fixes from foks@iatge.de (Thomas Foks) to some of the
 	German button labels, as reviewed by kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay
 	Marquardt).

	* ngMode.c (ngMoveFunction): Fix a few small memory leaks when
 	moving newsgroups in newsgroup mode.

Sun May 14 22:27:12 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* butdefs.h, buttons.c, cancel.c, xrn.h: Make the "cancel search"
 	button work again.  It was broken in 7.04-beta-1.

	* server.c: Fix a memory and temporary-file leak when posting an
 	article when INEWS is defined.

	* XRn.src, ngMode.c: For consistency with other modes and with the
 	mode buttons for newsgroup mode, the frame for the mode should be
 	called ngFrame, not newsgroupFrame.  Problem pointed out by
 	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu).

 *	* xrn-man.src: Add documentation of the format of KILL files.
  	Suggested by uri@watson.ibm.com.

Thu May 11 03:03:23 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
	7.04-beta-2.

Thu May 11 03:00:35 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* busyCursor.c: Only widgets that are subclasses of Core can have
	popups.  This fixes a coredumping problem in 7.04-beta-1.

 *	* XRn.src: Need to protect the binding for artMarkUnread() with
	~Shift so that it doesn't conflict with the binding for artMail().
	Otherwise, Shift-M in article mode won't pop up a mail window,
	it'll mark the current article unread.

Wed May 10 20:23:23 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* news.h, newsrcfile.c: Newsrc should be declared extern in the
	header file, and defined in only one .c file.

	* Imakefile: SCO needs to link against -lintl for the
	regular-expression routines, according to Rob Leland
	<root@dial-in.nw.dc.us>.

Wed May 10 02:45:19 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.src, patchlevel.h, xrn-man.src: Update version number for
	7.04-beta-1.

Wed May 10 02:22:04 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* Imakefile: Add -DXRN to the symbols defined when compiling, so
	that modules which are written to work as part of XRN and
	independently of it know that they're being compiled as part of
	XRN.

	* allMode.c: Some calls to setButtonSensitive() which really only
	needed to happen once were happening every time all mode was
	entered.  They have been fixed to only happen when the all mode
	widgets are first created.

	* allMode.c: Some button/action functions which previously failed
	to verify that they were called from inside all mode now correctly
	verify this before performing their functions.

	* allMode.c, ngMode.c: The code which resets the groups selected
	for a later move operation is now called only when the displayed
	list of newsgroups actually changes.

 *	* artMode.c: Some button/action functions have been updated so
	that they will behave correctly when they are called when the
	subject cursor is on an article other than the currently displayed
	one.

	* Imakefile, InfoLine.c, InfoLine.h, addMode.c, allMode.c,
        artMode.c, ngMode.c: A new "InfoLine" interface for creating a
        one-line information label (usually to be placed inside a pane)
        has been added and is used to create information lines for the
        various modes.

	* XRn.src: In translations and accelerators, use symbolic names
	for keys, instead of their hexidecimal values.  In particular, use
	"space" instead of 0x20, "Linefeed" instead of 0xff0a, and
	"Return" instead of 0xff0d.

 *	* XRn.src, xrn-man.src: The key bindings for the various modes
	have been updated.  A few key bindings were changed or removed,
	but for the most part, the primary goal was to add new key
	bindings so that much more can be done without reaching for the
	mouse.  Furthermore, all default key bindings are now documented
	in the man page.

 *	* XRn.src, allMode.c, allMode.h, xrn-man.src: Two new buttons,
	"allNext" and "allPrev", have been added in all mode to move the
	cursor to the next or previous newsgroup.

	* XRn.src, mesg.c: Some resources that were hard-coded in mesg.c
	have been moved into XRn.src.

 *	* XRn.src, butexpl.h, xrn-man.src: New functionality has been
	added to make it possible to move around in the subject list in
	article mode without the displayed article following the subject
	cursor.  For the most part, this change will be transparent to
	people who don't want to use this functionality.  However, the one
	non-transparent aspect of it is that the up and down arrows no
	longer display the next and previous article; instead, they move
	the cursor without changing the displayed article.  The 'P' and
	'N' keys retain the behavior which used to be bound to the arrow
	keys.  Users who prefer the old behavior can restore it by putting
	the following in their X resources:

		xrn*artFrame.subjects.translations: #overrid	\n\
			~Meta<Key>Up:	artPrev()		\n\
			~Meta<Key>Down:	artNext()		\n

	For more information about this new functionality, see the
	documentation about it near the beginning of the "ARTICLE MODE"
	section of the man page.

	* TODO: Remove the item about adding and documenting key bindings,
	because it has been done.

	* TODO: Add an item about making attribution lines customizable.

	* TODO: Add an item about documenting the widget tree in the man
        page.

	* artMode.c, compose.c, dialogs.c, utils.h, xmisc.c: Some "gcc
	-Wall" nits have been eliminated by initializing variables that
	don't really need to be initialized, but that make gcc complain
	about them possibly being uninitialized.

	* ButtonBox.c, ButtonBox.h, Imakefile, addMode.c, allMode.c,
	artMode.c, butdefs.h, buttons.c, buttons.h, cancel.c, compose.c,
	mesg.c, ngMode.c: The generic button code has been revamped, so
	that there is a generic "ButtonBox" interface for creating a
	widget to contain a box of buttons and for adding buttons to it.

	* addMode.c, allMode.c, artMode.c, busyCursor.c, busyCursor.h,
	butdefs.h, internals.c, ngMode.c, xmisc.c, xmisc.h, xrn.c: The
	code which turns the mouse pointer into a watch when XRN is busy
	has been rewritten to use Xt commands to set the cursor, rather
	than using Xlib commands directly.

	* config.h, xrn.c: The title-bar functionality has been removed.
	Title bars are the responsibility of the window manager, not of
	XRN.

	* TODO, buttons.c, config.h: The DONT_FORCE_BUTTON_TRANSLATIONS
	and matchTranslations functionality has been removed.  It's not
	relevant as long as we're not supporting Motif, and when we do put
	Motif back, we can put it back in a more correct way, if
	necessary.

	* artMode.c, artMode.h: The various lists of buttons have been
	reordered to be in the same order as the man page's list.

 *	* XRn.src, addMode.c, addMode.h, allMode.c, allMode.h, artMode.c,
	artMode.h, buttons.c, buttons.h, compose.c, internals.c,
	internals.h, ngMode.c, ngMode.h, resources.c, resources.h,
	server.c, server.h, xrn-man.src, xrn.c, xrn.h: In previous
	versions of XRN, all modes used the widgets to display data in --
	the top text window, the top info line, the top button box, the
	bottom text window, the bottom info line, and the bottom button
	box.  This structure was problematic because it took advantage of
	available screen real estate poorly (why should part of the XRN
	window be blank and unused in all modes except article mode?).  It
	also made it difficult to maintain the code.  Therefore, the code
	has been reorganized so that each mode has its own "Paned" widget
	which fills the entire XRN window when the mode is active.  There
	are probably all kinds of little user-visible aspects of this
	change, but the big ones are: (1) Screen real estate is utilized
	more fully -- for example, in newsgroup mode, there's no longer a
	bottom text window, info line or button box, which means that many
	more newsgroups can be listed in the same space.  (2) The
	"Bindings" resources and command-line options have been removed.
	Instead, users should use the "translations" resources for the
	various modes in order to set bindings.  The correct resource to
	use for customizing each mode's translations is given in the
	documentation for that mode in the man page.  (3) Because each
	mode uses separate widgets, it is now possible to customize the
	appearance of modes separately -- for example, you can use
	different fonts for the newsgroup or article lists in different
	modes.  (4) Because the widget hierarchy has changed, the names of
	some widgets have changed, and therefore some user X resources
	which refer to those widgets might no longer work.  See the XRN
	source code or the application-defaults file to find out about the
	new names of the various widgets.

 *	* server.c: Fix bug reported by
	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu): "I tried to
	connect to a news server that was down, and got the `failed to
	connect to NNTP server' message; I selected `exit'
	(because I knew `retry' wouldn't work), but .xrnlock remained."  The
	.xrnlock file is now properly deleted.

	* error_hnds.c: Allow ehErrorExitXRN to be called with a null
	string pointer if no death notifier should be displayed.

	* clientlib.c (server_init): After sending the MODE READER command
	to the NNTP server, detect if it returns an access-denied error,
	rather than looping forever disconnecting and reconnecting to the
	server.

Sun Apr 30 16:51:32 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* addMode.c: Fix a bug reported by
	philippe@pablo.physics.lsa.umich.edu (Philippe Brieu): When there
	are new groups to be added to the .newsrc and the user clicks on
	"Add after group" and then specifies a nonexistent newsgroup in
	the dialog box, XRN ignores the problem and pretends that the
	group was added to the .newsrc, when in fact it wasn't, which
	means that it comes up again the next time the user runs XRN.

Fri Apr 28 13:49:42 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* xrn-man.src: Rewrite the sections which talk about the various
	modes, and add a new section which talks about composing messages.

 *	* XRn.src: Add default buttons lists which don't display all
	buttons.  The button boxes were getting much too crowded, so I'm
	hiding by default the buttons whose functions can be done with the
	mouse in other ways (i.e., all the scrolling buttons), as well as
	the "Mail" buttons, because although that functionality should be
	available for consistency's sake, it doesn't have to be available
	by default, since XRN is a news reader, not a mail reader.

	* artMode.c: Rearrange the button lists to match the order in the
	man page.

	* Imakefile: Break up the steps for generating xrn.man into
	multiple steps, and make them a big more robust so that numbers as
	well as strings can be extracted from the configuration into the
	Makefile, and so that symbols which don't actually have any values
	can also be extracted.

	* xrn-man.sym: Add MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE.

	* xrn-man.sym: Add XLATE.

	* ngMode.c: Reorder the button list so it's in the same order as
	in the man page.

 *	* butexpl.h, ngMode.c, ngMode.h, xrn-man.src: Add ngPostAndMail
	and ngMail buttons.

 *	* allMode.c, allMode.h, butexpl.h, xrn-man.src: Add allPostAndMail
	and allMail buttons.

Thu Apr 27 12:18:18 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* XRn.src, artMode.c, artMode.h, butexpl.h, xrn-man.src: Add
	artPostAndMail and artMail buttons.  The former posts a message
	and sends it via mail as well, and the latter just sends mail.

	* compose.c: Woops; strcat should have been strcpy.

 *	* compose.c, resources.c, resources.h, xrn-man.src: Get rid of the
	extraMailHeaders X resource -- make its behavior the default.
	There's really no reason to do otherwise.

	* compose.c, mesg_strings.c, compose.h: Turn the post() function
	into post_or_mail(), and add a new post() function which calls it.
	Also, add a mail() function to just send a mail message, and
	post_and_mail() to compose a message for both posting and mailing.

 *	Don't include the X-Newsgroups and In-reply-to lines in a message
	that's being both posted and mailed, because in that case, they're
	redundant.

	* compose.h, allMode.c, artMode.c, ngMode.c: The argument to
	post() should be Boolean, not int.

Wed Apr 26 14:06:50 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Lots of code cleanup which probably isn't quite done,
	but this is a good stopping point.  Most of these changes aren't
	visible to the end user, but the code needs to be cleaned up
	before I can make some user-visible changes that I want to make.

Thu Apr 20 12:07:05 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* Imakefile: Use LOCAL_LIBRARIES, not EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS, to specify
	which libraries should get linked in.  Fix from Rein Tollevik
	<Rein.Tollevik@si.sintef.no>.

	* utils.c: Fixes from Rein Tollevik <Rein.Tollevik@si.sintef.no>
	to tconvert() so that it displayes 4-digit years and gets the
	timezone name correct.

Wed Apr 19 22:02:40 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* newsrc.l: It's YY_FLEX_LEX_COMPAT, not FLEX_LEX_COMPAT, in flex
	2.5.1.

Mon Apr 10 20:30:41 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Fix a memory leak when cancelling an article.

Sun Apr  9 23:17:55 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

 *	* compose.c: Fixed a a bug which was causing the includePrefix to
	be put every 256 characters in long lines when including an
	article in a followup or reply.  Also fixed a bug which could in
	very rare circumstances cause XRN to decide that the end of the
	header had been reached when in fact it handn't, when skipping the
	header when includeHeader is False.

Thu Apr  6 19:32:34 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* Significant user-visible changes in XRN 7.03:

	Usages of assert() have been fixed so that they never contain side
	effects.  This is important on systems (like HP-UX) which define
	NDEBUG, and therefore disable assertions, by default.  Problem
	pointed out by Rein Tollevik <Rein.Tollevik@si.sintef.no>.

	When GENERATE_EXTRA_FIELDS is set when compiling XRN, the timezone
	inserted into the time string is now truncated after the first
	three characters, to work around systems which use timezone values
	that are longer than that.  Problem pointed out by
	nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).

	A bug in XRN 7.02 which prevented article cancellation from
	working has been fixed.  The problem was pointed out by
	klaus@gauguin.legg.u-nancy.fr (Klaus Hartmuth).

	Two uninitialized memory references which might cause XRN to
	behave unpredictably on some systems have been fixed.

	A minor memory leak which occurs when XRN is started up iconified
	has been fixed.

Thu Mar 16 22:17:12 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* Significant user-visible changes in XRN 7.02:

	The code that checks before displaying each article whether the
	user is allowed to cancel it is now disabled by default, because
	it causes significant performance degradation at some sites.  A
	CANCEL_CHECK compile-time symbol which enables the feature has
	been added to config.h, along with an explanation of the feature
	and why it's disabled by default.

	The COMMON-PROBLMS file now explains why the Subject index is
	occasionally redrawn wrong in article mode (it's because of an Xaw
	bug) and how to work around the problem.

	The COMMON-PROBLMS file now explains why the buttons disappear
	when the height of the XRN window is changed (again, it's because
	of an Xaw bug) and how to work around the problem.

	The way XRN decides if it's talking to a "fast" NNTP server or
	not, and therefore if it should prefetch articles, has been
	changed.  There is now a new "prefetchMinSpeed"
	resource/command-line option, which specifies the minimum
	kilobytes/second speed that the NNTP server network link must
	reach in order for article prefetching to be enabled.  The default
	is 3 kb/s, which should disable prefetching on most 14.4 or 28.8
	SLIP or PPP lines.

	The "Session kill" and "Author kill" buttons in article mode no
	longer cause non-malloc()ed memory to be free()d.  This fix
	prevents memory corruption on some systems which could cause XRN
	to hang, crash, or function incorrectly.

	A minor memory leak when the user tries to open a composition pane
	when one is already open has been fixed.

	If the user tries to open a composition pane or cancel a message
	when a composition pane with a followup or reply in it is open,
	XRN no longer gets confused about the header fields of the article
	currently being replied to in the composition pane.

	The man page now documents that artFedUp is one of the buttons
	that can be confirmed.  The missing documentation pointed out by
	philippe@umich.edu (Philippe Brieu).

	The "ngListOld" Xt action procedure was incorrectly named
	"ngToggleGroups".  It has been renamed "ngListOld".  Problem
	pointed out by philippe@umich.edu (Philippe Brieu).

Fri Mar  3 15:08:37 1995  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@annex-1-slip-jik.cam.ov.com>

	* Significant user-visible changes in XRN 7.01:

	Clicking on "List Old" in article mode no longer results in a
	large number of error messages about unavailable articles.  This
	problem was originally reported by Konstantin Laufer
	<laufer@math.luc.edu>.

	The main window is now mapped before connecting to the NNTP
	server, rather than afterwards.  This allows messages about
	problems connecting to the server and about reading or writing to
	the .newsrc file to be displayed in the Information window instead
	of as text in the window from which XRN was started.  Furthermore,
	this allows X-based interaction with the user, before the NNTP
	connection has been established, if necessary.  Finally, this
	allows messages about the status of the connection to the NNTP
	server to be displayed in the top information line in the XRN
	window.

	Article "Lines:" fields which start with extra whitespace are now
	parsed properly.  This problem was originally reported by
	dstarks@rc.tudelft.nl (D. Starks-Browning).

	The Information window has been cleaned up sigificantly: (1) Some
	messages in the Information window which used to be displayed on
	two lines are now displayed on a single line.  (2) Rather than
	displaying the entire date before each message, display just the
	current time.  The day of the week, current date and year are
	useless and take up space.  (3) Rather than resetting the entire
	contents of the window each time a new message is added, just
	append the new message.  This is a significant improvement when
	XRN is being run over a slow network (e.g., SLIP).  (4) Don't
	limit the amount of text in the window.  (5) Add a "Clear" button
	to erase the contents of the window without dismissing it.

	An erroneous "Article not available" message when doing "Subject
	search" in article mode has been fixed.

	In article mode, the Subject index is now displayed and sorted
	properly when the number of digits in the article numbers of
	listed articles is not constant (e.g., when the displayed articles
	range from 9990 to 10010).

	The watchUnread command-line option/X resource now takes a list of
	regular expressions rather than a list of newsgroup names.  The
	list of regular expressions can be separated by spaces, tabs,
	newlines and/or commas.

	In article mode, the status message in the bottom information line
	has been made more terse, so that information in it gets cut off
	less frequently.

	This bug is now fixed: "If I press the <Prev> button when I'm
	reading the first article in a newsgroup, I have to press <Next>
	twice before I get the next article.  Pressing <Prev> more than
	once have exactly the same effect."  Problem reported by
	sturle.sunde@usit.uio.no (Sturle Sunde)."

	XRN is now mostly internationalized; the supported languages are
	currently English and German.  Most of the internationalization
	work was done by kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay Marquardt).

	The verboseKill command-line option/X resource is no longer a
	boolean.  Instead, it is a string containing zero or more of 'j',
	'm' and 's', to tell XRN which KILL messages the user wants to
	see.  For more information, see the man page.

	The NNTP AUTHINFO GENERIC protocol is now supported.  Changes from
	"chris (c.r.) lewis" <clewis@bnr.ca>, with some cleanup by me.

	The rescanOnEnter command-line option/X resource has been added.
	When true, XRN checks for new articles whenever entering a
	newsgroup, rather than only when rescanning all newsgroups.

	A file descriptor leak which could make XRN eventually
	unable to reconnect to the NNTP server if it ran for a long time
	has been fixed.

	When saving a message in an MX or RMAIL folder, an error is now
	displayed if the save fails, rather than just saying "done".

	In article mode, "Next group" now does the right thing even when
	"List old" was previously selected in newsgroup mode.  Previously,
	"Next group" would attempt to enter groups without unread articles
	and display lots of messages.

	In article mode, "Fed up" now finds the next group, rather than
	exiting into newsgroup mode, when "List old" has been selected in
	newsgroup mode.

	When verifying a message before sending it, check if there are
	duplicate fields that aren't allowed to be duplicated, and display
	an error message and refuse to send the message if there are.

	Don't truncate Subject lines unnecessarily when adding entries to
	KILL files.

	When adding an entry to a KILL file, quote special characters
	instead of replacing them with '.'.  This produces more accurate
	KILL file entries.

	The method by which the current position in the newsgroup index is
	stored in newsgroup mode has been completely reworked, to fix a
	large number of bugs with cursor positioning in newsgroup mode.

	Numerous changes related to prefetching: (1) The newsgroup index
	is now redrawn when we're done prefetching a newsgroup, because
	prefetching can change the index's contents.  (2) When XRN is
	prefetching a gropu and it discovers that the group has no unread
	articles in it, it immediately initiates a prefetch of the next
	group.  This means that once prefetching starts, it will continue
	until it finds a group with unread articles in it.  (3) XRN now
	displays messages in the top information line about the progress
	of prefetching and of processing KILL files.  (4) Previously, XRN
	would not prefetch the next group when a group was entered with
	"Goto group".  This restriction is now unnecessary and has been
	removed.  (5) Prefetching and KILL-file processing has been broken
	up into small chunks, the size of which are adjusted dynamically
	to prevent significant delays during prefetching.  (6) Newsgroup
	mode now prefetches the current group automatically whenever the
	current group changes.  This means, among other things, that a
	newsgroup will be prefetched immediately when XRN starts up and
	when the user rescans.  (7) Because prefetching is now much more
	efficient, prefetchMax has been set to 0 by default, i.e., by
	default, there is no size limit on which newsgroups can be
	prefetched.  (8) XRN now keeps track of whether it's talking to a
	"fast" NNTP server, and only prefetches articles in article mode
	if we are.

	XRN now keeps track of which articles have been KILLed (in the
	current XRN session only), so that the same article won't have
	KILL files run on it twice in a single XRN session.  XRN still
	doesn't update THRU in the KILL files, though. 

	The handling of host names that appear in messages posted and
	mailed by the user has been changed somewhat.  The most noticeable
	effect of this change is that the real host from which the user is
	posting is now more likely to appear in the header of a posted
	message.

	Automatic periodic rescanning is now disabled by default.  See the
	documentation for the rescanTime option in the man page for
	information on how to enable it.

	Fixed a number of bugs in "List old" in article mode, including:
	(1) If you've read articles first through n-1 and n+1 through last
	in a newsgroup, and you entered the newsgroup so that you're
	viewing only article n, and you click on "List old", it will list
	only articles first through n, and not n+1 through list. (2) when
	you click on "List old", the current article is changed to the
	first article in the newsgroup.  That shouldn't happen.  It should
	list old articles but leave you on the same article you were on
	before.

	When XRN can't connect to the NNTP server, instead of looping
	forever as it used to, it displays a dialog and asks the user
	whether or not it should continue trying or exit.

	When an error is returned by the NNTP server in response to an
	attempt by XRN to post a message, XRN now states explicitly that
	it is an error from the NNTP server rather than a local error.
	This is useful if, e.g., the NNTP server's disk is full and it
	displays "No space left on device", which the user might wrongly
	interpret as an error about a local disk being full.

	Articles are now marked saved properly when they are saved in MH
	or RMAIL folders, in addition to when they're saved in plain
	files.

	All temporary files created by XRN are now created with mode 600,
	for privacy and security reasons.  Problem pointed out by Philippe
	Michel <michel@thomson-lcr.fr>.

	A KILL file entry containing "\\" at the end of its regular
	expression will now work properly.

	The newsgroup mode buttons are now removed when entering all mode,
	to make more space for the all mode listing.  Furthermore, the
	"All groups" newsgroup mode button now unhighlights properly after
	it is selected.

	The geometry of the Information window is no longer specified
	explicitly in XRN's application defaults.  If a user wants the
	window to appear in a specific location, its geometry can be set
	in a personal .Xresources or .Xdefaults file.  It's not the place
	of XRN to set the location of the window explicitly.

	When the user clicks on "Exit" in article mode, the newsgroup's
	status just before the user started reading articles in it is
	restored.  Previously, all articles in the Subject index would be
	marked unread when "Exit" was used, which meant (for example) that
	if the user clicked on "List old" and then "Exit", all articles in
	the newsgroup would be marked unread, which is obviously wrong.

	The code which adjusts the displayed text in the newsgroup or
	subject index to keep the number of lines above and below the
	cursor within a certain range has been improved in a number of
	ways, including: maxLines can now be negative in order to specify
	a minimum number of lines below the cursor, rather than a maximum
	number of lines above the cursor;, the index will never scroll
	past the end of the available text, i.e., once the last line of
	available index text is displayed in the last line of the index
	widget, scrolling will stop, even if the minLines/maxLines
	constraints aren't met.

	When a newsgroup is entered from all mode, it is no longer
	subscribed automatically.  The new behavior is what was in XRN
	6.17, but it was changed in XRN 7.00 to subscribe automatically.
	This is arguably wrong, because users often use all mode to
	"browse", visiting newsgroups without subscribing to them.

	Window redraws have been optimized in a number of places.

	The NNTPSERVER environment variable now takes precedence over the
	nntpServer X resource, but not over the nntpServer command-line
	option.  Change suggested by Reg Clemens <reg@dwf.com>.

	The amount of memory taken up by XRN while it is running has been
	greatly reduced, especially for users who subscribe to many
	newsgroups or who subscribe to newsgroups with many articles in
	them.

	When a newsgroup is subscribed in add mode, XRN now immediately
	updates its idea of the first and last articles in the newsgroup,
	so that it shows up in the newsgroup mode index immediately (as
	opposed to after the next rescan) if it has unread articles in it.

	The width of the lines in the newsgroup index in newsgroup mode,
	the Subject index in article mode, and the newsgroup list in all
	mode, is now adjusted dynamically based on the width of the XRN
	window.  The indexLineLength command-line option/X resource has
	therefore been removed.

	When XRN creates a file name in which to store the .newsrc file
	temporarily while updating it, it now puts ".temp-" at the
	beginning of the last component of the temporary file name, rather
	than appending "-temp" to the end of it.  This means that the
	temporary file name will still be unique on systems which have
	short file names.  Problem pointed out by kay@zhv.basf-ag.de (Kay
	Marquardt).

	Remove the hard-coded limit of 127 characters on newsgroup names.
	There is no longer any limit (except for the amount of memory
	available to XRN, of course :-) on newsgroup name lengths.

	Aborted messages are now saved in the user's deadLetters file, so
	that they aren't lost if the "Abort" button is clicked
	accidentally.

	The behavior of killing a subject in article mode is now exactly
	the same as when it is killed from a KILL file.  I.e., when you
	kill a subject in article mode, exactly the same articles will be
	marked read as would be if you had selected "Local kill" on the
	same subject in a previous invocation of XRN.  Previously,
	interactive subject killing used a different algorithm from
	KILL-file killing.

	A new subjectScrollBack command-line option/X resource has been
	added.  When it is true (which is the default, XRN will always
	scroll back to the current article in the subject index after
	doing operations on other articles.  When it is false, XRN will
	attempt to maintain the position you scrolled to before performing
	the operation.

	If XRN encounters a system error while getting an article, it
	displays a retry notifier instead of just claiming that the
	article is unavailable.  This is important when, e.g., the
	disk on which the temporary directory is located fills up.

	Some buttons are now made insensitive when they can't currently be
	used: allPost, artPost, artFollowup, artFollowupAndReply, and
	ngPost when the news server doesn't allow the user to post;
	allMove and ngMove when no groups are currently selected;
	artHeader when stripHeaders and leaveHeaders aren't set; artLast,
	ngPrevGroup when there isn't any previous article or group to go
	to; artContinue when no previous search has been done; artListOld
	when it has already been clicked on once; artCancel when the
	current user isn't allowed to cancel the article.

	The onlyShow X resource's behavior has been modified so that it
	actually displays the number of articles specified, even if some
	of the articles at the end of the newsgroup are unavailable or
	have already been read.  Furthermore, although only the number of
	articles requested with onlyShow are displayed, the other articles
	are not marked read, so if you read the displayed articles and
	then exit and reenter the newsgroup, they'll be available (or if
	you click on "List old" in the newsgroup, or if you do a subject
	search backwards).  If you want the earlier articles to be marked

	option.

	* Significant user-visible changes in XRN 7.00 (this list is
	incomplete):

	There are now key bindings for the arrow keys in newsgroup and
	article modes.

	Instead of always leaving five spaces for the article numbers in
	the subject index and putting a tab after the number on each line,
	figure out how many digits the last article number in the
	newsgroup has, and use that many digits as the width of the column
	for the article number, and put a space after it instead of a tab.
	This allows more of the Subject to be displayed when the article
	numbers have less than five digits, and prevents lots of
	whitespace because of the tab when the article numbers have more
	than five digits.  Problem pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

	If the Subject or Newsgroups field is missing or empty when the
	user attempts to send a message, display an error, and refuse to
	send the message.

	Fix the following bug: compose a posting to two newsgroups, the
	first of which you don't get at your site and the second of which
	you do.  When you click on "Send", instead of posting the message,
	XRN will claim that you have no postable newsgroups on the
	Newsgroups line, because it misses the last newsgroup on the line.

	Add support for X-newsreader and X-mailer headers in outgoing
	messages, but disable them by default.  Suggested by Michael
	Salmon <Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>.

	The Distribution: header included in a cancel message should be
	identical to the Distribution: header in the article being
	cancelled, or shouldn't be there at all if there is no
	Distribution: header in the article being cancelled.  The default
	distribution in app_resources.distribution shouldn't have anything
	to do with what goes into a cancel message.  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	There is no longer a default distribution (unless the person
	installing XRN expicitly compiles one into the program.

	Related messages in the Information window are now appended to
	each other correctly in more cases.

	There are now buttons in newsgroup mode to scroll the newsgroup
	list.  Patches from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	Support to use application contexts and to support the X11R6
	session manager has been added.  Patches from "Ralph R. Swick"
	<swick@x.org>.

	Files in the XRN source distribution which might cause problems on
	systems with short file names have been renamed.

	A "MODE READER" command is now sent to the NNTP server upon
	startup, in case it's an INN-like server which needs to be told
	explicitly to go into news-reader mode.  Problem pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr
	(Vincent ARCHER).

	Fixed a bug that was preventing ignoreNewsgroups from working
	under SYSV_REGEX.  Fix submitted by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE has been changed so that it's closer to 320,
	which is 80*4 (i.e., allow a four-line signature).  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	Free memory returned by regcmp() when it is no longer needed.
	Leak pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	When creating a regular expression to add to a KILL file, protect
	the ')' and ']' characters in addition to '(' and '['.  Suggested
	by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Clean up the code for getting the time zone when
	REALLY_USE_LOCALTIME is defined.  The SOLARIS part of the fix was
	initially suggested by mitchell@aol14.wff.nasa.gov (Richard
	Mitchell 1026).

	Change the print command for UNIX to "lp -sc" (for SYSV) or "lpr"
	(for non-SYSV).  It used to be "enscript -g", but far more sites
	have lpr and lp than have enscript.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans
	(MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Change the message in the info line when KILL file processing is
	done.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Say in the info line message what newsgroup's KILL file is being
	processed.

	Always include article text when calling an external editor
	command.  Fix from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).
