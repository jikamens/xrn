Tue Nov  8 18:30:03 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.00.

Tue Nov  8 18:23:24 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* server.c (wrapText): One of the allocations of this_line was using
	app_resources.breakLength instead of maxLength, which is a problem
	(and can cause segfaults) if lineLength is greater than breakLength.

Fri Nov  4 20:39:27 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad: Add arrow bindings for artNext() and artPrev() in
	article mode.

Thu Nov  3 15:02:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 15.

Wed Nov  2 16:03:59 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* utils.h: Under HP-UX, need to define _HPUX_SOURCE before
	including <stdio.h>, because <stdio.h> includes <sys/stdsyms.h>,
	and defining _HPUX_SOURCE won't do the right thing if it's done
	*after* <sys/stdsyms.h> is included.  Problem pointed out by
	Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* strstr.c, strtok.c, vprintf.c: Don't include <stdio.h>., since
	"utils.h" does.

	* utils.h: Don't define index and rindex if they're already
	defined.  Problem pointed out by schuld@btv.ibm.com (Dave
	Schuler).

Mon Oct 31 16:22:01 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 14.

Mon Oct 31 16:20:27 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Make sure that From and (when specified by the user)
	Reply-To lines are included in all outgoing messages.  Bug
	reported by rcmodsb@mo6.rc.tudelft.nl (David Starks-Browning).
	Also, some other minor code cleanup which shouldn't affect
	functionality.

Thu Oct 27 16:12:31 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* buttons.c: Fixed a type in a function declaration that gets used
	only under X11R4.  Fix by dbrooks@ics.com.

Thu Oct 27 14:53:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 13.

Thu Oct 27 14:51:13 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* server.c (wrapText): Make a variable that is negated and used as
	an array reference signed instead of unsigned, because apparently,
	the expression "- x" takes on type unsigned if the variable x is
	unsigned, and the resulting value used as the array reference is
	huge and wrong.  Slightly different fix for this reported by Phil
	Garner <garner@signal.dra.hmg.gb>.

Wed Oct 26 20:50:31 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* README: Be more specific about what to include when reporting a
	working environment.

	* README: Updated and reformatted section about supported
	platforms.  Told people to provide details when sending me
	information about working platforms.

Wed Oct 26 18:14:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 12.

Tue Oct 25 13:06:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c: Only disallow ',' or expand '&' in Header.fullname
	when it was extracted from the GECOS field of the user's passwd
	file entry.  In other contexts, the ',' and '&' are not special.
	Pointed out by Michael Salmon <Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>.

	* Imakefile: Instead of having multiple definitions of
	EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS and DEFINES, define them once (in the section of
	the Imakefile that people probably don't have to edit) and include
	in them variables conditionally set elsewhere in the Imakefile.

	Instead of including $(MOTIFDEFINES) in all of the OS_specific
	settings of XRN_DEFINES, just include it in the one setting of
	DEFINES.

	* Imakefile, utils.h: Get rid of the special XRN_DEFINES for HP-UX
	in Imakefile.  Instead, if hpux is defined in utils.h, define
	_HPUX_SOURCE and include <sys/stdsyms.h> to get all the other
	needed symbols.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Mon Oct 24 20:21:20 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* error_hnds.c: Use VOID_SIGNAL, which is defined by the
	Imakefile, instead of a whole bunch of OS_specific symbols, to
	decide whether signal() returns a void-returning function or an
	int-returning function.

	* newsrc.l: Don't need to declare yylineno if FLEX_LEX_COMPAT
	(which will be supported in flex 2.5, according to the author) is
	defined.

Mon Oct 24 17:57:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 11.

Mon Oct 24 17:54:41 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  <jik@cam.ov.com>

	* compose.c, save.c, server.c, utils.h: If we're declaring our own
	popen and pclose functions, call them xrn_popen and xrn_pclose
	instead of popen and pclose, so as not to conflict with
	declarations in system header files and not to replace behavior
	that library routines are expecting (e.g., if they're expecting to
	use the system popen and pclose).  Call popen and pclose as
	xrn_popen and xrn_pclose everywhere they're called, and if using
	the system popen and pclose, define xrn_popen and xrn_pclose to
	popen and pclose.  Fix the prototype of xrn_popen to agree with
	the prototype in utils.h.  Declare pclose in utils.h even if we're
	using the system one instead of ours, because unfortunately some
	systems don't bother to declare it.  The problems with
	popen/pclose were pointed out by Axel Nennker
	<nennker@cs.tu-berlin.de>.

	* internals.c: Because of a recent modification to server.c, a tab
	is no longer used to separate article numbers from Subject lines
	in the Subject array.  Instead, a space is used, so look for that.

	* server.c: Instead of always leaving five spaces for the article
	numbers in a newsgroup and putting a tab after the number on each
	line, figure out how many digits the last article number in the
	newsgroup has, and use that many digits as the width of the column
	for the article number, and put a space after it instead of a tab.
	This allows more of the Subject to be displayed when the article
	numbers have less than five digits, and prevents lots of
	whitespace because of the tab when the article numbers have more
	than five digits.  Problem pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

	* Imakefile: Move the OV_CAMBRIDGE configuration stuff into a
	single block and out of the way, so that people will be less
	likely to stumble over it when configuring for their own sites.

	* config.h: Linux doesn't need tempnam.  Fix from
	glenr@cu74.crl.aecl.ca (Glen Reesor).

	* newsrc.l, Imakefile: Newer versions of flex support a "-l"
	option which causes yylineno to be supported, but they don't
	support any way of determining at compile-time whether or not it
	was specified.  In other words, although the FLEX_SCANNER symbol
	can be used to determine whether or not we *might* need to define
	and maintain yylineno ourselves, it doesn't tell us anything
	definite.  I've file a bug report about this with the maintainer
	of the flex, but in the meantime, I've documented both in
	Imakefile and newsrc.l that the "-l" option should not be
	specified when building lex.yy.c from newsrc.l.  Problem pointed
	out by glenr@cu74.crl.aecl.ca (Glen Reesor).

Sun Oct 23 21:00:30 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 10.

Sun Oct 23 20:58:46 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg_strings.c: Add NO_NEWSGROUPS, DEFAULT_ADDED, EMPTY_ADDED
	and FILL_IN_RESEND messages, to be used by compose.c.

	* compose.c (Call_Editor): Instead of passing the template text
	into Call_Editor, pass a boolean indicating whether it should
	retrieve the template from the ComposeText widget and save it into
	the editor file.  This allows callers to tell Call_Editor to
	resave a modified template when in the middle of editing.  This is
	an enhancement, not a bug fix, and is necessitated by some other
	fixes.  Also update all invocations of Call_Editor for the new
	syntax.

	If the Subject field is missing, add an empty Subject field to the
	message and tell the user to fill it in and resend.  Also, if calling
	Call_Editor to re-edit the message, tell it to resave the message into
	the editor file.

	If the Subject field is empty, tell the user to fill it in and
        resend.

	If there is no Newsgroups field in the message, don't just put a
	default Newsgroups field into the message and send it.  A program
	should never post messages to newsgroups not explicitly requested
	by the user.  Instead, add a default (or empty) Newsgroups field
	to the message, and tell the user to edit it and then resend.

	In composePane, free the header template as soon as it's no longer
	needed -- a little earlier than it was being freed before, since
	it's no longer being passed into Call_Editor.

	* compose.c (compSendFunction): Don't assume that there's a space
	after the colon on the Subject line -- the user could have removed
	it.  This fixes a bug which could cause uninitialized memory to be
	referenced when checking the posting before sending it when INN
	was defined.

	* compose.c (newsgroupsStatusUnion): Don't miss the last newsgroup
	on the Newsgroups line if there are multiple groups there.  Here's
	an example of where this bug was a problem: compose a posting to
	two newsgroups, the first of which you don't get at your site and
	the second of which you do.  When you click on "Send", instead of
	posting the message, XRN will claim that you have no postable
	newsgroups on the Newsgroups line, because it misses the last
	newsgroup on the line.

	* config.h: SunOS doesn't need our version of strtok or strstr.

	* avl.h, clientlib.c, internals.c, save.c, utils.h: Use CONST
	instead of const in more cases.  Reported by Odd Einar Aurbakken
	<oea@ifi.uio.no>.

	* strstr.c: Declare the two arguments to strstr separately, to
	make sure that the CONST specifier is applied to both of them.
	Problem reported by Odd Einar Aurbakken <oea@ifi.uio.no>.

Fri Oct 21 20:01:44 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 9.

Fri Oct 21 14:05:22 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg.c, mesg.h, utils.h, vprintf.c: Be more paranoid about when
	to use stdarg and when to use varargs.  Problem first reported by
	jback@tristan.corsair.com (Joseph F.Backo).

Thu Oct 20 17:15:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 8.

Thu Oct 20 17:09:53 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c, config.h: Only include X-newsreader and X-mailer
	lines in postings and mail messages if
	IDENTIFY_VERSION_IN_MESSAGES is defined, and don't define it by
	default.  First requested by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr
	(Vincent ARCHER).

	* compose.c: The Distribution: header included in a cancel message
	should be identical to the Distribution: header in the article
	being cancelled, or shouldn't be there at all if there is no
	Distribution: header in the article being cancelled.  The default
	distribution in app_resources.distribution shouldn't have anything
	to do with what goes into a cancel message.  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

Thu Oct 20 15:22:45 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 7.

Thu Oct 20 15:10:13 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c: Allow DISTRIBUTION to not be defined, in which case
	an empty Distribution: header is included in postings if there's
	no other source for the distribution to be used.

	Don't include an empty Distribution: header in cancel messages.

	* config.h: Don't use distribution "world" by default.  Problem
	pointed out by Odd Einar Aurbakken <oea@ifi.uio.no>.

	Add more documentation about exactly what DISTRIBUTION does and
	how to use it.

	* compose.c: Put an X-newsreader field in all postings (or
	messages that are both followups and replies), and an X-mailer
	field in all mail messages.  Fix from Michael Salmon
	<Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>.

Wed Oct 19 18:52:38 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* utils.h: Include prototypes only if _NO_PROTO isn't defined
	*and* FUNCPROTO is defined.  Frankly, I'm not sure whether
	_NO_PROTO really should be checked at all.  I can't find anything
	in either the X Imake stuff or the X header files that defines it.
	I guess there's no harm in excluding prototypes if it happens to
	be defined, though.

Mon Oct 17 19:23:50 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 6.

Mon Oct 17 15:37:29 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* mesg.h, mesg.c:
	Add mesgDisableAppend and mesgEnableAppend to allow mesgPane appending
	(the XRN_APPEND option to mesgPane) to be enabled or disabled outside
	of a call to mesgPane.  This is useful if a function A calls another
	function B that generates calls to mesgPane, and A wants the messages
	generated by B to appear in a single block.

	* buttons.c:
	In artListOldFunction, if the first article in the group is
	unavailable, step forward until an available article is found, rather
	than giving up.  Also, enable mesgPane appending after the first error
	is displayed, so that all of the errors about unavailable articles
	will appear in one message block.

	* Imakefile: Generate mesg_strings.h automatically from mesg_strings.c.

	* mesg_strings.c:
	Delete a message string no longer used by artListOldFunction.

	Add the string names from mesg_strings.h as comments in a specific
	format in this file, so that mesg_strings.h can be generated
	automatically from this file.

	* config.h:
	Comment out the DO_NOT_EAT_TYPE_AHEAD #define and add a comment
	indicating that it doesn't work right now.  Problem pointed out by
	Gordon Berkley <gordonb@mcil.comm.mot.com>.

	* xrn.man:
	Add documentation for buttons that weren't documented, and change a
	couple instances of "backwards" to "backward" in the button
	documentation.

	* XRn.ad:
	Get rid of the *ngQuit.info resource, set to "Quit XRN (app defaults
	file)".  Not sure why it was there in the first place.

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, buttons.c:
	Add buttons in newsgroup mode to scroll the newsgroup list.
	Patches from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* xawmotif.c: Need to cast argument to XtFree to char *.  Fix from
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Sun Oct 16 21:12:17 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* internals.c:
	Don't try to get articles in prefetchGetArticles if newsgroup->current
	is 0, which means that setUpGroup() couldn't find any unread articles
	in the group.  Before, a coredump could happen in this situation.

	* buttons.c, config.h:
	Force buttons in the top button box to have the same translations
	as the rest of the xrn window, so that hitting space when the
	mouse is on top of one of them won't activate it when using Motif.
	Fix from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang), with minor
	modifications by me.

Sun Oct 16 17:43:35 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 5.

Sun Oct 16 17:32:21 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* buttons.c, config.h:
	Force buttons in the top button box to have the same translations
	as the rest of the xrn window, so that hitting space when the
	mouse is on top of one of them won't activate it when using Motif.
	Fix from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang), with minor
	modifications by me.

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad:
	Make the up and down arrows do the same thing as 'p' and 'n' when
	viewing the list of newsgroups.  Suggested by Gordon Berkley
	<gordonb@mcil.comm.mot.com>.

	* README:
	Mention more about dxrn, including that it can be compiled to provide
	a DECwindows interface or spiffier Motif interface (MXRN) under UNIX.

	* still-to-do/cancel: Deleted this file because I cannot duplicate
	the bug described in it, and it was reported so long ago that it's
	likely that it was fixed in some other way by now.

	* error_hnds.c, error_hnds.h, resources.c, xrn.c:
	Patches from "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org> to support the X11R6
	session manager.

	* buttons.c, xthelper.c, xrn.c, error_hnds.c, dialogs.c:
	Updated to use application contexts.  Patches submitted by "Ralph
	R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* buttons.c:
	Updated the code in setTranslations a little bit.  Patches submitted
	by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* config.h:
	HP-UX has its own strcasecmp(), and therefore doesn't need ours.
	Pointed out by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

	* compose.c:
	Add _ARGUMENTS((void)) to the prototype for signatureFile().

	* butdefs.h: Wrap some long lines.

	* Imakefile:
	"Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org> says that Ultrix doesn't need to define
	NOSTDHDRS.

	I forgot to include $(MOTIFDEFINES) in XRN_DEFINES on Solaris.

	* README, xrn.man:
	Updated names of xmh-insrt-repl, COMMON-PROBLMS, Xresources.sam.

	* Renamed files whose names were more than fourteen characters
	long, so that they could be used on systems with a
	fourteen-character file name limit.  File name changes:
	  COMMON-PROBLEMS		->	COMMON-PROBLMS
	  Xresources.sample		->	Xresources.sam
	  contrib/XRn.bindings.emacs	->	contrib/XRn.bind.emacs
	  contrib/xmh-insert-reply	->	contrib/xmh-insrt-repl
	  contrib/VMS-CLIENTLIB.C	->	contrib/VMSCLIENTLIB.C
	Problem pointed out by "Ralph R. Swick" <swick@x.org>.

Thu Oct 13 23:32:36 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* Imakefile, compose.c, internals.c, utils.h:
	Patches for OSF/1 2.0 support.  From Randy Coulman
	<coulman@skdad.usask.ca>.

Thu Oct 13 12:37:29 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for beta 4.

Thu Oct 13 12:35:01 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* dialogs.c:
	Make an array static that doesn't really need to be static, because of
	bugs in older C compilers (most notably, compilers based on pcc).
	Problem pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent
	ARCHER).

	* clientlib.c:
	Make sure the server is in reader mode by sending a "MODE READER"
	command to it after connecting (and ignoring the error if there is
	one, since it probably just means that the server doesn't understand
	the MODE command; if it really means that the user doesn't have
	permission to go into READER mode, we'll notice the problem later
	anyway).  Problem pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr
	(Vincent ARCHER).

Wed Oct 12 19:46:39 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* Imakefile:
	Under BSD/386, need to link against -lcompat.  Reported by Matt Bush
	<xomox@boris.eden.com>.

	* server.c:
	Fixed a bug that was preventing ignoreNewsgroups from working under
	SYSV_REGEX.  Fix submitted by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* utils.c:
	Use CONST instead of const so that non-__STDC__ systems can compile.
	Pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* utils.h:
	Define CONST to const or nothing depending on whether or not __STDC__
	is defined.

	Don't declare strtok unless NEED_STRTOK is defined.

	* strstr.c, strtok.c:
	Include utils.h to get the CONST definition, and to make sure that
	the declarations in it don't conflict with the definitions here.

	* buttons.c, compose.c, utils.h:
	Delete the strstr() declaration from individual files and move it
	into utils.h.  Also, don't declare it in utils.h unless
	NEED_STRSTR is defined.

	* avl.c, internals.c:
	Missing _ARGUMENTS() around arguments that will only work if
	__STDC__.  Pointed out by archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent
	ARCHER).

	* xawmotif.c, server.c, internals.c, clientlib.c, utils.h, avl.c:
	Use XtMalloc, XtRealloc, XtCalloc, XtFree, instead of malloc, realloc,
	calloc, free.

	* config.h:
	1000 is too high for MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE.  It should be closer to 320,
	which is 80*4 (i.e., allow a four-line signature).  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* README:
	Document that Imakefile and config.h need to be made writeable with
	chmod before being edited.  Problem pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	* Imakefile: Use C comments instead of '#' comments.  Pointed out by
	archer@cett.alcatel-alsthom.fr (Vincent ARCHER).

	Delete the text saying where to send suggestions, since it was missing
	an address anyway, and since that information is already given in
	README.

	* cursor.c, internals.c:
	Free memory returned by regcmp() when it is no longer needed.  Leak
	pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* cursor.c:
	In subjectSearch, assert that a search has been done before when the
	regular expression passed in is null.  This is just to make sure that
	none of the functions calling subjectSearch are misbehaving.

	* cursor.c, server.c:
	Delete some declarations that are unnecessary because they're in
	utils.h.

	* internals.c:
	When creating a regular expression to add to a KILL file, protect the
	')' and ']' characters in addition to '(' and '['.  Suggested by
	Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Add a comment indicating that I don't understand why special
	characters are protected by replacing them with '.' instead of by
	quoting them with backslash.

Wed Oct 12 13:13:12 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.00 beta 3.

Wed Oct 12 13:05:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* utils.c:
	Clean up the code for getting the time zone when
	REALLY_USE_LOCALTIME is defined.  The SOLARIS part of the fix was
	initially suggested by mitchell@aol14.wff.nasa.gov (Richard
	Mitchell 1026).

	* xrn.man:
	Update version number.  Problem pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* config.h:
	Change the print command for UNIX to "lp -sc" (for SYSV) or "lpr" (for
	non-SYSV).  It used to be "enscript -g", but far more sites have lpr

	* utils.h: Include <memory.h> under Solaris.  I'm not sure why this is
	necessary, since <stdlib.h> should get included and should declare
	malloc and realloc, but for some reason it didn't get declared,
	according to a "make" log sent to me by phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com
	(Phil Gross).

	* config.h:
	Sun doesn't really need strcasecmp.  Pointed out in "make" output from
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* Imakefile:
	Define SOLARIS and link against -lgen under Solaris.  Suggested by
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* utils.h, newsrcfile.c, clientlib.c, compose.c, internals.c, refile.c, resources.c, save.c, utils.c, server.c:
	Move "#define index strchr" out of C files into utils.h.  Also, add
	"#define rindex strrchr", and make sure this happens on VMS, SOLARIS
	and SYSV.  phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross) pointed out the
	need for this fix.

	* clientlib.c:
	Solaris no longer needs a different getservbyname declaration.  Fix
	from phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

	* MotifXawHack.h:
	Fix another function prototype vs. promoted argument problem that
	didn't turn up before because it's in the Motif code.  Problem
	reported by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* mesg.c:
	Need to include <Xm/Label.h> when doing Motif, because we're using
	XmCreateLabel.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* internals.c:
	Change the message in the info line when KILL file processing is done.
	Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Say in the info line message what newsgroup's KILL file is being
	processed.

	* Imakefile:
	Add XRN_DEFINES for HPArchitecture.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Indent the #ifdef's in the XRN_DEFINES block, to make the nesting
	clearer.

	* Imakefile:
	Don't assume that everyone is using GNU make -- don't use GNU make
	"ifdef ... else ... endif" construct unless OV_CAMBRIDGE is defined.
	Pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* Imakefile, utils.h:
	Use HasVoidSignalReturn in the Imakefile to determine whether signal
	handlers should return void.  Simply the declaration of SIG_PF0 in
	utils.h to use the VOID_SIGNAL symbol defined if necessary by the
	Imakefile, and also to use _ARGUMENTS() for the arguments of the
	SIG_PF0 typedef.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Tue Oct 11 16:22:49 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h: Update version number for beta 2.

Tue Oct 11 16:12:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c:
	Can't take the address of an array in a call to buildSubject.
	Instead, assign its address to a pointer and take the address of
	that.  Reported by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* resources.c:
	Delete the separate command-line option list for VMS, and instead
	convert the options in it to lower case under VMS before calling
	XtInitialize.

	* compose.c:
	Always include article text when calling an external editor command.
	Fix from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

	* config.h:
	Add a comment (from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland)) documenting
	XRN_PREFETCH_UNREAD_ONLY.

	* README, config.h:
	Add CONFIG_H_IS_OK symbol to config.h, which determines whether or
	not to print the error about editing config.h, so that people can
	configure the program by editing only the Imakefile.  Document
	this change in README.  Change suggested by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

	* README:
	Document what to do about OV_CAMBRIDGE and "#error" in the config.h
	file.  The need for this was first pointed out by Jay Vassos-Libove
	<libove@libove.mindspring.com>.

	* buttons.c:
	TRANSLATIONS_NOT_FREED patch in setTranslations.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* MotifXawHack.h, dialogs.c, mesg.c, xawmotif.c, xrn.c:
	Patches for Motif support from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* utils.h:
	Correct malloc and realloc declarations for SGI.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* xrn.c:
	Missing arguments for the NO_APP_DEFAULTS_MSG string in a call to
	mesgPane.  First pointed out by mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

	* utils.h, internals.c:
	Delete regexp routine declarations from internals.c and add them to
	utils.h (well, actually, most of them were already duplicated in
	utils.h, but the declaration for regex() was missing).

	* compose.c:
	Arguments to XtVaCreateManagedWidget should be cast to XtArgVal, not
	XtPointer.  First pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per
	Hedeland).

	* buttons.c, cursor.h, error_hnds.h, internals.c, server.h:
	Change some prototype arguments to "int" so that there aren't
	conflicts with K&R function definitions that cause arguments to be
	promoted to int.

	* strstr.c:
	Insert a couple of casts to get rid of warnings from the compiler.

	* compose.c: strncmp should have been strcasecmp.  First pointed
	out by mush@sunota.cat.com (Paul Mauschbaugh).
