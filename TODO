The Ever growing list of things that should be done and things that would 
be nice if they were done.... (and even worse, it's not up to date)

- When done prefetching a newsgroup and still in newsgroup mode, the
  newsgroup list should be updated.  However, doing so may cause
  problems, so need to make sure it's OK before doing it.
- When someone clicks on "Followup" for an article marked
  "Followup-To: poster", the dialog that pops up should offer three
  options -- followup, reply, and followup & reply, not just the
  followup and reply options.
- I clicked on "Followup & Reply" for a posting in news.groups that
  had "Followup-To: sender" in its header.  Ignoring for a moment the
  fact that "sender" is an invalid thing to put there, the compose
  pane that I got said "X-Newsgroups: sender" in it.  It should have
  said "X-Newsgroups: news.groups", since the X-Newsgroups header
  should list the newsgroups that the original article was posted in,
  not the newsgroup that the followup is being posted in.
- Say the newsgroup under your cursor has unread articles in it but
  that all of them will be KILLed when you enter the newsgroup.  Say,
  too, that the next newsgroup is in the same situation.  When you hit
  the space bar to enter the group, it will try to enter the group,
  realize that it's empty, and stay in newsgroup mode; however, it
  will also start a prefetch for the second group.  When you hit space
  to enter the *second* group after the prefetch is finished, it'll
  again try to enter the group, realize that it's empty, and stay in
  newsgroup mode, but this time it won't start to prefetch the next
  group (i.e., the third group from where your cursor originally was).
  At least, I *think* this is what's happening.  Need to investigate
  to confirm that it's really happening, and if so, figure out how to
  make the prefetch keep going until it finds a group with unread
  articles in it.
- Make DO_NOT_EAT_TYPE_AHEAD work.
- Fix mesg.c so that instead of displaying the full output of ctime,
  including the day, date and year, in the message pane, it displays
  just the current time.  After all, the user is using the program
  interactively and therefore doesn't need to be told what the current
  day, date and year are, and the extra information is clutter that
  should be gotten rid of.
- Make matchTranslations support the bottom button box too.
- Merge DXRN into this version of XRN.
- Make the "Continue" button insensitive when there was no previous
  Subject search in the current newsgroup, thus making the "No
  previous regular expression" check (and message) unnecessary.
- Figure out how to make the KILL file stuff support case-insensitive
  searches.  The best way to do this is probably to add an option for
  XRN to use the GNU regexp routines, which I believe take options to
  tell them to do case-insensitive searches.  Need to investigate
  further.
- Turn info() and infoNow() into varargs functions like mesgPane(),
  and fix all calls to them -- calls with strings with % in them need
  to have the %'s escaped, and calls that use sprintf into a buffer
  first can get rid of the buffer.
- Add a "saveSentMessages" option and command line flag
  ("-saveSentMessages" to disable, "+saveSentMessages" to enable,
  disabled by default) to save all successfully sent messages
  automatically in app_resources.savePostings.
- getarticle return
- read updated .newsrc file (XRN detects this, but should allow you to reread)
- prefetch should occur at end of list, not largest number (sorted subject...)
- spawn child for posting, sigchld in parent for confirmation...
- clean up KILL file support
   - handle '{' correctly
        The regular expression \{<m>,<n>\} is supposed to match between
        m and n occurences of the previous character. To kill an expression
        of the form "{foo}", xrn requires the braces to be quoted. Rn, on
        the other hand complains if the braces are quoted.  Rn, on
        the other hand complains if the braces are quoted since the
        expression is not valid.  Test: /{foo}/:j
   - allow field names (Subject/From) in an entry
   - prompt for KILL expression in article mode
	local kill (current subject and typein)
	global kill (current subject and typein)
	local author kill (current subject and typein)
	global author kill (current subject and typein)
   - kill author globally...
   - edit kill file
   - closer to RN
- look at input during prefetch to see if it should be cancelled (or handled).
- remove tmp files as you go, not at the end of the group
  (necessary for large groups with large postings)
- replace popen of mailer with something better so status code can be checked
- fixup postArticle to do Header fixup, not sendFunction...
- check if follow-to is same as newsgroup, warn if not, option to turn this off.
- warn if followup will go to more than one group.
- option to capitalize, not-cap the group name when saving.
- xrn.slowLink - don't refetch article for saving
- thread support
- break up buttons.c into multiple files
	generic stuff, art buttons, all buttons, ng buttons, add buttons, ...
- XHDR message on server timeout
- handle =ng in active file
- command to skip quoted/included sections
- user selectable cursors
- text and reference based searching
- strip leading and trailing spaces from newsgroup name in the Newsgroups field
- control C to disconnect/reconnect and return to top level...
- allow partial selection on subject line - partial selection determines
  what amount of the subject or author is to be killed....
- local server (clientlib.c replaced with something that accesses local files)
