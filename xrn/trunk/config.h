  If you are installing XRN on a multi-user system, on which it might

  .Xdefaults files, you should probably set ALLOW_RESOURCE_PASSWORDS

  it to 1 if you want to allow users to specify their passwords in X
  resources or on the command line.

  If the CANCEL_CHECK feature is enabled by default, then XRN will use
  the XHDR command to retrieve a number of fields from the server each
  time it displays an article, in order to determine if the user
  running XRN is entitled to cancel the article, in order to determine
  whether or not to make the "Cancel" XRN button sensitive.

  At some sites, this causes significant performance degradation
  because the NNTP server is very slow to process XHDR commands.
  Therefore, this feature is disabled by default.  If, however, your
  site's server is capable of processing XHDR commands quickly, you
  can enable it.

  Note that in any case, XRN will not let a user cancel an article
  he/she isn't entitled to cancel -- if this feature is disabled and
  the user clicks on the "Cancel" button when viewing an article
  written by someone else, XRN will check at that time if the user is
  allowed to cancel the article, and display an error if not.

  BREAKING NEWS: This feature is now enabled by default because XRN no
  longer uses XHDR requests to retrieve header fields of displayed
  articles -- it parses the already downloaded article header.
  However, the ability to disable this feature is being preserved in
  case we go back to using XHDR in the future.

  XRN tries to encourage good netiquette by asking for confirmation
  when the user is about to post a message to a large number of
  groups.  If the user attempts to post a message to
  CROSSPOST_PROHIBIT or more groups, XRN will simply prohibit the
  posting and require the user to reduce the number of newsgroups.
  Otherwise, if the user attempts to post to CROSSPOST_CONFIRM or more
  groups, XRN will display a dialogue and ask the user to confirm the
  cross-posting or re-edit the posting.  Otherwise, if the user
  attempts to post to FOLLOWUPTO_CONFIRM or more groups and there
  isn't a Followup-To line in the user's posting with less than
  FOLLOWUPTO_CONFIRM groups in it, XRN will display a confirmation
  dialogue.

  Any of these parameters can be set to 0 here to disable the related
  check.  The settings of CROSSPOST_CONFIRM and FOLLOWUPTO_CONFIRM can
  be overridden by the warnings.posting.crossPost and
  warnings.posting.followupTo X resources.

  CROSSPOST_PROHIBIT is set to 0 by default, because I don't believe
  that I should be making policy decisions for other sites.
