Wed Oct 12 13:13:12 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h, xrn.man:
	Update version number for 7.00 beta 3.

Wed Oct 12 13:05:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* utils.c:
	Clean up the code for getting the time zone when
	REALLY_USE_LOCALTIME is defined.  The SOLARIS part of the fix was
	initially suggested by mitchell@aol14.wff.nasa.gov (Richard
	Mitchell 1026).

Wed Oct 12 02:10:16 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* xrn.man:
	Update version number.  Problem pointed out by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* config.h:
	Change the print command for UNIX to "lp -sc" (for SYSV) or "lpr" (for
	non-SYSV).  It used to be "enscript -g", but far more sites have lpr
	and lp than have enscript.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Tue Oct 11 21:33:00 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* utils.h: Include <memory.h> under Solaris.  I'm not sure why this is
	necessary, since <stdlib.h> should get included and should declare
	malloc and realloc, but for some reason it didn't get declared,
	according to a "make" log sent to me by phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com
	(Phil Gross).

	* config.h:
	Sun doesn't really need strcasecmp.  Pointed out in "make" output from
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

Tue Oct 11 21:20:27 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* Imakefile:
	Define SOLARIS and link against -lgen under Solaris.  Suggested by
	phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

Tue Oct 11 21:12:45 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* utils.h, newsrcfile.c, clientlib.c, compose.c, internals.c, refile.c, resources.c, save.c, utils.c, server.c:
	Move "#define index strchr" out of C files into utils.h.  Also, add
	"#define rindex strrchr", and make sure this happens on VMS, SOLARIS
	and SYSV.  phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross) pointed out the
	need for this fix.

	* clientlib.c:
	Solaris no longer needs a different getservbyname declaration.  Fix
	from phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).

Tue Oct 11 20:39:29 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* MotifXawHack.h:
	Fix another function prototype vs. promoted argument problem that
	didn't turn up before because it's in the Motif code.  Problem
	reported by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* mesg.c:
	Need to include <Xm/Label.h> when doing Motif, because we're using
	XmCreateLabel.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	* internals.c:
	Change the message in the info line when KILL file processing is done.
	Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Say in the info line message what newsgroup's KILL file is being
	processed.

	* Imakefile:
	Add XRN_DEFINES for HPArchitecture.  From Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

	Indent the #ifdef's in the XRN_DEFINES block, to make the nesting
	clearer.

Tue Oct 11 20:14:04 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* Imakefile:
	Don't assume that everyone is using GNU make -- don't use GNU make
	"ifdef ... else ... endif" construct unless OV_CAMBRIDGE is defined.
	Pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

Tue Oct 11 17:39:42 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* Imakefile, utils.h:
	Use HasVoidSignalReturn in the Imakefile to determine whether signal
	handlers should return void.  Simply the declaration of SIG_PF0 in
	utils.h to use the VOID_SIGNAL symbol defined if necessary by the
	Imakefile, and also to use _ARGUMENTS() for the arguments of the
	SIG_PF0 typedef.  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE)
	<eyckmans@imec.be>.

Tue Oct 11 16:22:49 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* XRn.ad, XRnMotif.ad, xrn.h: Update version number for beta 2.

Tue Oct 11 16:12:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* compose.c:
	Can't take the address of an array in a call to buildSubject.
	Instead, assign its address to a pointer and take the address of
	that.  Reported by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

Tue Oct 11 15:50:31 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* resources.c:
	Delete the separate command-line option list for VMS, and instead
	convert the options in it to lower case under VMS before calling
	XtInitialize.

Tue Oct 11 15:33:15 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* compose.c:
	Always include article text when calling an external editor command.
	Fix from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland).

Tue Oct 11 15:21:06 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* config.h:
	Add a comment (from per@erix.ericsson.se (Per Hedeland)) documenting
	XRN_PREFETCH_UNREAD_ONLY.

Tue Oct 11 15:18:35 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* README, config.h:
	Add CONFIG_H_IS_OK symbol to config.h, which determines whether or
	not to print the error about editing config.h, so that people can
	configure the program by editing only the Imakefile.  Document
	this change in README.  Change suggested by per@erix.ericsson.se
	(Per Hedeland).

Tue Oct 11 15:02:49 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* README:
	Document what to do about OV_CAMBRIDGE and "#error" in the config.h
	file.  The need for this was first pointed out by Jay Vassos-Libove
	<libove@libove.mindspring.com>.

Tue Oct 11 14:51:59 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* buttons.c:
	TRANSLATIONS_NOT_FREED patch in setTranslations.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Tue Oct 11 14:40:34 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* MotifXawHack.h, dialogs.c, mesg.c, xawmotif.c, xrn.c:
	Patches for Motif support from mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Tue Oct 11 14:36:54 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* utils.h:
	Correct malloc and realloc declarations for SGI.  First pointed out by
	mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Tue Oct 11 14:34:02 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* xrn.c:
	Missing arguments for the NO_APP_DEFAULTS_MSG string in a call to
	mesgPane.  First pointed out by mikey@euky.engr.sgi.com (Mike Yang).

Tue Oct 11 14:31:04 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* utils.h, internals.c:
	Delete regexp routine declarations from internals.c and add them to
	utils.h (well, actually, most of them were already duplicated in
	utils.h, but the declaration for regex() was missing).

Tue Oct 11 14:23:39 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1)

	* compose.c:
	Arguments to XtVaCreateManagedWidget should be cast to XtArgVal, not
	XtPointer.  First pointed out by per@erix.ericsson.se (Per
	Hedeland).

	* buttons.c, cursor.h, error_hnds.h, internals.c, server.h:
	Change some prototype arguments to "int" so that there aren't
	conflicts with K&R function definitions that cause arguments to be
	promoted to int.

	* strstr.c:
	Insert a couple of casts to get rid of warnings from the compiler.

Tue Oct 11 09:50:52 1994  Jonathan I. Kamens  (jik@gza-client1.cam.ov.com)

	* compose.c: strncmp should have been strcasecmp.  First pointed
	out by mush@sunota.cat.com (Paul Mauschbaugh).
