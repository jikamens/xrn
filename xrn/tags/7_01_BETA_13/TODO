The Ever growing list of things that should be done and things that would 
be nice if they were done.... (and even worse, it's not up to date)

- Make ^S in newsgroup and all modes search through the newsgroup
  index and then move to the beginning of the line on which the match
  was found.
- Figure out how to make index line length determined automatically
  based on the width of the window and the width of the font used to
  display the index.  Also, instead of just growing the width of the
  subject in the article index, grow the subject and author width
  (i.e., make them have some ratio to each other, perhaps up until the
  author reaches some maximum width).

  Also, make the width of the newsgroup column in the newsgroup list
  (both in newsgroup mode and all mode) grow dynamically based on the
  width of the window, just like the subject index does (or should).
- Send in bug report about how the Text widget drops a character when
  wrapping a word longer than the line length.
- Break up internals.c into smaller files.
- When I "Local Kill" a series of articles in succession when running
  XRN over a slow network (SLIP), when it's done KILLing and puts the
  cursor on the next unread article, the cursor flashes several times.
  I'm not sure, but it may flash as many times as articles I killed.
  I need to investigate this one further.  I think this only happens
  when the article list scrolls while doing the killing.  This is
  probably related to an Xaw Text widget bug that I can't fix (I've
  already sent in a bug report about it to the X Consortium).
- Modularize all the other Xaw usages in the code into simplified
  interfaces.
- Put back Motif support.
- Notice when the XRN window changes size, and call
  adjustMinMaxLines() to make the cursor visible again.
- Investigate bug: Running XRN on Linux with XFree86-3.1, on the local
  display, with NNTP over a modem, the "Cancel search" button doesn't
  work.  Perhaps it's trying to retrieve subjects of articles that
  don't exist and therefore never actually checks the button?
- Investigate bug reported by uri@watson.ibm.com, that article mode
  exits to newsgroup mode if it encounters an unavailable article.
- Send in a bug report about the fact that XawTextEnableRedisplay
  always redisplays the whole window, even if nothing has changed (I
  *think* -- need to confirm this).
- Send in a bug report about the fact that XawTextSetInsertionPoint
  causes a full redisplay instead of just the cursor being erased and
  being redrawn (this may only happen when it is called when redisplay
  is disabled -- need to investigate more).
- Optimize article mode so that it only redraws the upper text widget
  when it has to.
- Send in a bug report and patch about the fact that the AsciiSrc
  widget doesn't always ignore XtNlength when useStringInPlace is
  false, even though it's supposed to.
- Optimize all mode so that it only redraws the lower text widget when
  it has to.
- Optimize add mode so that it only redraws the upper text widget when
  it has to.
- The code in signatureFile() is unnecessarily obtuse and complex.
  For example, the "sigfile" variable doesn't need to be dynamically
  allocated *or* static.

  Clean this code up.
- "When leaving article mode to return to all mode, the cursor should
  either remain on the previously read group (my favorite) or go to
  the next one.  Instead, it always jumps to the very first
  group."  Suggested by Michel Eyckmans (MCE) <eyckmans@imec.be>.

  More generally, keep track of where we are in the "all" list just
  like we keep track of where we are in the newsgroup index, using a
  global variable containing the group we're currently on, and finding
  it in the list whenever updating all mode.
- Support WM_DELETE_WINDOW.  Suggested by nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be
  (Alain Nissen).
- Append the NNTP server name to saveNewsrcFile and to lockFile just
  as it's appended to newsrcFile, so that when using multiple news
  servers, just specifying a different nntpServer is enough for
  everything to work.

  Note that we should only append the NNTP server name to
  saveNewsrcFile and lockFile if we found a newsrcfile with the NNTP
  server name appended to it.  That way, multiple XRN processes will
  not try to write to a non-extended newsrcFile at the same time.

  Suggested by nissen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be (Alain Nissen).
- Display newsgroup descriptions somehow in all mode and/or newsgroup
  mode. and/or add mode.
- Allow subject index and article text fonts to be specified on a
  per-newsgroup basis in X resources.  Suggested by uri@watson.ibm.com.
- if you type a character in the save dialog while the save is
  happening (i.e., after you already typed the file name and hit
  return), the character makes it into the dialog before it gets
  popped down, and shows up the next time you go to save (if you save
  again while reading the group).  Possibly true of all dialogs.
- numerous functions in server.c (e.g., getauthorlist, getlineslist
  and getsubjeclist) use exactly the same algorithm for figuring out
  how to talk to the server, and then parse the response differently.
  They should be modified to use a common iterator to get the data
  from the server.
- should be possible to highlight and kill a range of articles.
- subscribeHandler doesn't display an error if "Last group" is
  selected and there is no last group.
- subscribeHandler should put a message in the info line indicating
  what it did.
- Fix this bug (reported by Reg Clemens <reg@dwf.com>):
  First bring up XRN, and select a group.
  I see 7 lines of buttons in the middle of the screen, ranging from
  Quit -> List_old.

  Now reach up to the upper Right Hand corner of the border and make
  the Widget TALLER or SHORTER.  *DO NOT* change its width.

  The 7 lines of buttons will collapse to 3 lines from Quit->Goto_Article.

  If you then quit the group and (re)open it or another group you get
  back to the 7line display of buttons.

  Strange.

  Now go back to the corner and make the widget WIDER or Narrower,
  then change the height again, the above behaviour no longer occurs.

  Weird.
- Add X resource to optionally process Xref headers in articles being
  caught up in a newsgroup.
- I connected to an INN server that I wasn't allowed to use.  Instead
  of getting a useful message from XRN, I got "Unexpected EOF on NNTP
  server socket -- server is probably malfunctioning".
- Go through all of the X resources that are hard-coded as
  widget-creation arguments in the program and move as many of them as
  possible to the app-defaults file.
- Go through all the uses of XtSetValues and XtGetValues and convert
  them to use XtVaSetValues and XtVaGetValues whereever possible, to
  eliminate unnecessary argument arrays.  Same thing for the
  Create*Widget functions.
- Fix the way buttons are laid out in the Information window and the
  dialog windows in the Motif interface.  The problem is that
  designating one button as the default in the Information window
  causes its active area to shrink while the other button stays the
  same size, rather than causing its active area to grow.  The
  resulting active area of the default is too small.  Let me take this
  opportunity to say that the Motif API is brain-damaged, stupid,
  completely non-intuitive, and never does what you want it to do.
  What kind of widget library, when you tell it to highlight a button
  as the default, does so by shrinking the drawing area for the button
  so that its text no longer fits in it properly, instead of by
  growing the button to make room for the default shadow?  Xaw may be
  ugly, but at least it's straightforward and does what you expect it
  to and what you tell it to.

  I've spent literally hours trying to figure out the correct way to
  make it grow the button instead of shrinking it, but I can't figure
  it out.  The Motif manual is no help.  Ugh.
- Make sure all temporary files are being deleted properly (I think
  there may be a temporary file leak somewhere).
- Allow the number of articles to be retrieved to be specified upon
  entering the newsgroup, if the number of unread articles in the
  group exceeds a certain threshold, rather than making it only
  configurable via showOnly.  Also, there should be a way to view the
  last n articles in the newsgroup without marking the earlier unread
  articles read, which is what showOnly does.
- Facility for unpacking and decoding multi-part articles.
- Fix stuff that uses MAXPATHLEN to use the correct POSIX call instead
  on POSIX systems.
- PGP support?
- Add a mode in which only the header of an article is fetched, unless
  the user tries to scroll down, in which case the rest of the article
  is fetched.
- Make the program multithreaded, or use a subprocess for
  communication for the server, or something so that the UI and NNTP
  stuff can work independently of each other (the WorkProc stuff used
  now to do prefetching is a hack that approximates this, but it
  really isn't good enough splitting the NNTP stuff into a separate
  thread or process is the right way to do this, but it's a lot of
  work).

  Another option is to make all of the NNTP code event-driven, and to
  use XtAppAddInput to add the NNTP socket as an input source, so that
  input from the NNTP server gets processed whenever there are no
  other X events to be handled.
- Add X resources (and command line options) corresponding to the
  USER, HIDDENHOST, HIDDENPATH and FULLNAME environment variables.
- Fix up the action of "Followup & Reply" so it only includes mail
  headers in the mail message and news headers in the posting, and
  comments out other headers with "X-" or something.
- Add something to the buttonList X resource syntax to allow someone
  to say, "Put all buttons not listed explicitly here."  It should
  obviously only be specifiable once in any particular button list.
  This will allow people to move specific buttons to the beginning or
  end of the list in the order they want, without having to update
  their resources for new buttons after every release.  Suggested by
  phigro@phigro.rnd.symix.com (Phil Gross).
- Should XRN try to connect to a news server with host name "news" by
  default if NNTPSERVER isn't set and SERVER_FILE doesn't exist (and
  the server name can't be determined from the INN configuration
  file)?
- Merge the functionality of the post, followup and gripe functions
  into the followup_or_reply function, so that all of the
  header-adding code only needs to happen in one place.
- Add a 'Post & E-mail' button to go along with the 'Followup & Reply'
  button.
- When someone clicks on "Followup" for an article marked
  "Followup-To: poster", the dialog that pops up should offer three
  options -- followup, reply, and followup & reply, not just the
  followup and reply options.
- I clicked on "Followup & Reply" for a posting in news.groups that
  had "Followup-To: sender" in its header.  Ignoring for a moment the
  fact that "sender" is an invalid thing to put there, the compose
  pane that I got said "X-Newsgroups: sender" in it.  It should have
  said "X-Newsgroups: news.groups", since the X-Newsgroups header
  should list the newsgroups that the original article was posted in,
  not the newsgroup that the followup is being posted in.
- Make DO_NOT_EAT_TYPE_AHEAD work.
- Make matchTranslations support the bottom button box too.
- Merge DXRN into this version of XRN.
- Make the "Continue" button insensitive when there was no previous
  Subject search in the current newsgroup, thus making the "No
  previous regular expression" check (and message) unnecessary.
- Figure out how to make the KILL file stuff support case-insensitive
  searches.  The best way to do this is probably to add an option for
  XRN to use the GNU regexp routines, which I believe take options to
  tell them to do case-insensitive searches.  Need to investigate
  further.
- Turn info() and infoNow() into varargs functions like mesgPane(),
  and fix all calls to them -- calls with strings with % in them need
  to have the %'s escaped, and calls that use sprintf into a buffer
  first can get rid of the buffer.
- Add a "saveSentMessages" option and command line flag
  ("-saveSentMessages" to disable, "+saveSentMessages" to enable,
  disabled by default) to save all successfully sent messages
  automatically in app_resources.savePostings.
- getarticle return
- read updated .newsrc file (XRN detects this, but should allow you to reread)
- prefetch should occur at end of list, not largest number (sorted subject...)
- clean up KILL file support
   - handle '{' correctly
        The regular expression \{<m>,<n>\} is supposed to match between
        m and n occurences of the previous character. To kill an expression
        of the form "{foo}", xrn requires the braces to be quoted. Rn, on
        the other hand complains if the braces are quoted.  Rn, on
        the other hand complains if the braces are quoted since the
        expression is not valid.  Test: /{foo}/:j
   - allow field names (Subject/From) in an entry
   - prompt for KILL expression in article mode
	local kill (current subject and typein)
	global kill (current subject and typein)
	local author kill (current subject and typein)
	global author kill (current subject and typein)
   - kill author globally...
   - edit kill file
   - closer to RN
   - Support KILLLOCAL and KILLGLOBAL environment variables a la trn.
   - "Author search".
- remove tmp files as you go, not at the end of the group
  (necessary for large groups with large postings)
- replace popen of mailer with something better so status code can be checked
- fixup postArticle to do Header fixup, not sendFunction...
- check if follow-to is same as newsgroup, warn if not, option to turn this off.
- warn if followup will go to more than one group.
- option to capitalize, not-cap the group name when saving.
- don't refetch article for saving
- thread support
- XHDR message on server timeout
- handle =ng in active file
- command to skip quoted/included sections
- user selectable cursors
- text and reference based searching
- strip leading and trailing spaces from newsgroup name in the Newsgroups field
- control C to disconnect/reconnect and return to top level...
- allow partial selection on subject line - partial selection determines
  what amount of the subject or author is to be killed....
- local server (clientlib.c replaced with something that accesses local files)
- reading an MH folder as a newsgroup (suggested by Luigi Semenzato
  <luigi@CS.Berkeley.EDU>).
