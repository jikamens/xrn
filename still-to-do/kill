Below is a message that we received about a change
in functionality between xrn 6.15 and 6.17.

The code changes from 6.15 to 6.17 in buttons.c that is suspect is
in routine _artKillSession.

*** 4722,4728 ****
   * XXX get subject, kill using data structures, rebuild SubjectString
   */
  {
!     XawTextPosition left, right;
      char *subject;
      char *cursubject;
      char *filename, *question;
--- 4827,4833 ----
   * XXX get subject, kill using data structures, rebuild SubjectString
   */
  {
!     XawTextPosition left, right, save;
      char *subject;
      char *cursubject;
      char *filename, *question;
***************
*** 4736,4741 ****
--- 4841,4847 ----
        return;
      }
      ArtPosition = left;
+     save = ArtPosition;
  #ifdef ellen
      XawTextGetSelectionPos(Text, &left, &right);
      XawTextUnsetSelection(Text);
***************
*** 4768,4774 ****
        }
      }
      /* set the cursor back to the beginning of the subject screen */
!     ArtPosition = 0;
      FREE(subject);
      infoNow("Subject has been killed, returning to first unread article");
      if (getNearbyArticle(art_UNREAD, &filename, &question, &artNum)
--- 4874,4880 ----
        }
      }
      /* set the cursor back to the beginning of the subject screen */
!     ArtPosition = save;
      FREE(subject);
      infoNow("Subject has been killed, returning to first unread article");
      if (getNearbyArticle(art_UNREAD, &filename, &question, &artNum)
***************

If you could comment on why the change was made, or what problem
the change solved, it would be appreciated.  Otherwise, we would
like to see the line
      infoNow("Subject has been killed, returning to first unread article");
changed to
      infoNow("Subject has been killed, returning to next unread article");

Thanks much,

	Dale Moore for Help@cs.cmu.edu

Date: Mon, 6 Jul 92 15:23:21 EDT
From: sgall@GS35.SP.CS.CMU.EDU
Sender: sgall@GS35.SP.CS.CMU.EDU

X VERSION, RELEASE, and PATCH LEVEL MACHINE:
    X Version 11, Release 4, Patch Level ?? 

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    IBM RT under mach

SYNOPSIS:
    Session Kill malfunction

DESCRIPTION:
    Session Kill now moves you to the next unread article in the group. 
    As far as I remember, it used to move you to the first unread article.
    I suppose this is a bug rather than an intended change (as I see this as 
    pretty inconvenient, and cannot think of any advantages of this).

REPEAT BY:
    Pick any group with more unread articles, move somewhere in the middle and
    fire.

SAMPLE FIX:
    ??

Thanks,

- -- Jiri Sgall
